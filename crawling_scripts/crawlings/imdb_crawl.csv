Minimalistic and devoid of the usual special effects which made famous the French illusionist and pioneering filmmaker, this is, indeed, a rather simple story; however, what it lacks in innovation it makes up for humour and irony. Exactly 125km outside of the bustling city of Paris, a not-so-vigilant sentry is assigned the relatively easy task of guarding a blank white wall where postering is strictly forbidden. But, when the guard marches past the partition, an audacious bill poster plasters the surface with an advertisement--and moments later--another bold worker pastes up yet another poster. Before long, a great advertisement war breaks out behind the sentry's back. Is the officer of the law inept or is he, plainly, apathetic?",1896,short,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxZmQzZjAtODM3NC00YWUyLWE2NmEtODAxODZmOGEzYzQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@.jpg

Suddenly, in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears and surprises the astronomer. At the command of the Fairy Queen, who suddenly appears, Satan vanishes; she awakens the astronomer and as he goes forward to meet her she disappears. The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent. She first seats herself, and the astronomer puts his arms out for her, thinking perhaps he can reach her, when she disappears and in her place there stands a marble statue of a man. The astronomer, in his efforts to reach her falls to the ground. Rising and seeing the statue he is so incensed that he grabs a club, and as he is about to crush the statue it suddenly becomes alive. The large moon again appearing to his view he throws himself into it, and the moon, winking one eye, proceeds to chew him up. The moon's large teeth are seen to sink into the astronomer again and again until he is reduced to small pieces, when piece by piece he is ejected from the moon's mouth and lies there, one piled on the other. Suddenly in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears, but the Fairy Queen drives him off again. She proceeds to pick up different parts of the astronomer and hurls them across the room, and piece by piece they take their proper position in the chair, until the astronomer is again seated as he was before. Suddenly he comes to life again. He moves forward to grasp the Fairy Queen, when suddenly she disappears.

First, Captain Alfred Dreyfus is accused of treason to France when his hand-writing is discovered to match that of the Bordereau. Sent to Devil's Island, the unfortunate officer spends his time within the Palisade outside his prison, until he's put in leg irons due to innuendo published by an anti-Dreyfusard newspaper. Around the same time, Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, who admitted forging evidence against Dreyfus, commits suicide in prison by the means of a razor concealed in his luggage. Because of this, it is now decided Dreyfus must be tried again in Rennes, where he is reunited with his wife during his imprisonment. Then, several weeks before the trial, the defense attorney Fernand Labori is attacked by an anonymous anti-Dreyfusard attacker who was never identified. Thankfully, he survives in time to present his case. Finally, since the anti-Dreyfusard claims are still at work, the second trial again results in condemnation; and because the eleven-part serial was made seven years before acquittal, the director never managed to entirely depict the entire story. A lot is left to be desired after the final installment ends.",1899,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRhNjMwZmUtNGUzOS00YmMwLTk4NjgtYjczNjkyYTU0MDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzUyMjQ3NTQ@.jpg

To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.",1901,short,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY1ZmU5OTItY2EyYy00MWZhLWJiZDUtYmQxYmY5NTVjNmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@.jpg

When he opens it again he finds that they have been transformed into seven young girls, who rush out and chase after him, beating him unmercifully. They shut him up in the coffer from which his gold has vanished. The miser pushes open the lid of the coffer, and to his profound despair finds that both young girls and money have disappeared.

0000446,Kit Carson,"Short,Western",United States,us,N/A,N/A,4.8,25,"This subject is a production upon which was spent a great deal of time and money. It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, ""Kit Carson,"" his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.",1903,movie,N/A

0000460,The Pioneers,"Western,Short",United States,us,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"THE LOG HOUSE [THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS]. Here we see in the midst of a primeval forest, a little clearing and the rude log-house erected by the sturdy frontiersman. A little girl leaves the cabin, and tripping daintily along the forest path in her bare feet, goes to a neighboring spring for water. What she sees lurking in the shadowy thickets causes her to fly back to the cabin for her life. She has no sooner passed the threshold, slamming the door behind her, when a half dozen painted Indians burst into view in close pursuit. Immediately the long rifle-barrel of the pioneer protrudes from a loophole in the cabin wall. It speaks, and a savage leaps into the air and falls clutching the sod. The other Indians slink back, only to reappear an instant later crawling through the grass like snakes and pushing bundles of dry limbs and grass before them. The settler's rifle speaks again and again, but the savages succeed in pushing the combustible material against the house, and in an instant it is fiercely blazing. AN INDIAN MASSACRE [BURNING OF THE CABIN AND MURDER OF THE SETTLERS]. A little girl runs in with the alarm. The door is quickly locked and barred and the long rifle appears at the loop-hole and is frequently fired. The Indians gradually close in on the ill-fated home, and finally have it ablaze from a fire of brushwood. The Indians, now in a frenzy over the success of their fiendish enterprise, procure a log and using it as a battering ram they hurl themselves upon the door and batter it in. The pioneer rushes out to defend his loved ones, but he is quickly overcome and tomahawked, and his wife as quickly meets the same fate. The little girl, terror-stricken by the awful scenes she has witnessed, is seized by the savages and carried off a prisoner. THE OATH! [DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES] In the next scene all that is left of the cabin is a smoldering ruin. A company of trappers come rapidly out of the forest and discover the bodies of the unfortunate man and woman. With bared heads, and in most impressive fashion they register an oath never to rest until they have wreaked vengeance on the Indian murderers and rescued the child. THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL [CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN]. A magnificent scene showing the savages leading their captive along a winding path on the mountain-side. The little girl sagaciously leaves a trail by tearing a bit from her dress. The trappers following shortly after discover the clue and press on in pursuit, encouraged by the knowledge that the girl is probably still living. VENGEANCE [RESCUE OF THE CHILD FROM THE INDIANS]. The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly.

0000487,The Great Train Robbery,"Short,Western",United States,us,N/A,N/A,6.9,522,"The first scene shows the chief as he explains to his followers the plan of the great train robbery. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing.",1904,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyMjAxMzEtNzEzYy00MGUxLWJkNGMtZjQ1MjkwY2M5NDk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYwMjAyMzM@.jpg

A rival appears on the scene, razors are drawn and finally a duel is arranged, at which both suitors, accompanied by their seconds, appear on the field of honor and exchange shots at thirty paces; one of the combatants is carried off the field, while our original hero remains the master of the situation, and the girl, arriving at the moment, is so pleased with his valor that arrangements for the wedding are made at once. The happy climax is reached at last and the marriage ceremony makes the two coons one and ends the ""wooing"" in a wedding. Next is seen the home of the young couple, but quite a change has taken place. No longer does the colored gallant overwhelm his lady with presents and similar attentions. Put the familiar sign of ""Washing Done Here"" is apparent, and while the woman toils at the wash tub the married coon smokes, drinks and enjoys himself at his leisure until he decides to go out and enjoy the sights and pleasures of the town. In turn he visits a trap game and several other gambling scenes, not forgetting various saloons, at which he accumulates a very perceptible package. His gambling experience has been unsuccessful and he loses not only his money but his clothes as well, and finally is compelled to rob a scarecrow in order to get clothes enough to get home again at all, which he finally gains in a very disheveled and ragged condition. The unfortunate coon has not been home long before he is attacked by imaginary foes as the result of his drinking bout; seizing a broom he gives battle wildly but is surprised by his wife, who, disgusted with the condition in which her husband has returned, attacks him viciously and gives him the beating he so richly deserves and ends by throwing a tub of suds and dirty water all over him.",1907,movie,N/A

The dances that were identified with the apache dance beyond the variety dance in the bars and dance cafes were varied. There is no surviving spelling of this dance as a salon dance or ""social dance"".

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand must leave her for the sake of a count who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: ""I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me."" Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretentious villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: ""All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard."" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her.

The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a ""line of sweetness long drawn out."" Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a ""Louis Quinze."" The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, ""O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!"" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for ""blues"" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit.",1907,movie,N/A

The procession passes a restaurant, where two Englishmen, Sir Hopkins and Mr. Jackson, are sitting between the Turkish guests. The two foreigners perceive the strange Eastern performance. The young Mr. Hopkins falls in love with the beautiful Sulejma. He imagines he receives a look from the black eyes, which promises him a great reward if he will exert himself and obtain it. He at once sets to work with all his energy. From a wandering chemist he buys an opiate, his friend takes it and succeeds in putting it into a bottle of wine intended for the caliph's harem guard. When the two eunuchs are sleeping soundly on their guard, the daring young man sneaks into the harem to see if he has understood the black eyes right. His appearance creates great consternation among the ladles of the harem. He has just made sure that he did understand the language of the black eyes as the caliph appears, and for this time puts an end to his impudence. The two sleeping eunuchs are imprisoned, and the new guard is cautioned to keep a sharp lookout. The lovesick young man keeps his aim in view. That which cannot be gained in one way, must be obtained in another. He buys a basket and some clothes from an old woman, and disguised as a basket woman he easily gains admittance to the harem. This time he is more successful. Sulejma sends the slaves away, gets into the basket and permits the courageous young man to carry her away. At the city gateway the fugitives are overtaken. The pursuers are close by, and Sulejma cannot run as quickly as necessary. A Turk is just passing by with two horses: quick as lightning Mr. Hopkins pounces upon him, throws him to the ground and jumps into his saddle. Jackson helps Sulejma on the other horse and off they go. Jackson stays back, prepared to sacrifice his own life, rather than let the caliph outside the city wall. He shoots the caliph and then sinks down, shot by one of his pursuers' bullets. His and the caliph's death have saved Mr. Hopkins' life and that of his sweetheart. The consternated guards lose their senses and forget the pursuing.

But his young and pretty daughter wants to have a younger and handsomer bridegroom, and therefore one can easily understand that she refuses the old suitor when the father introduces him to her. In the moonlight the young people meet and talk over their future prospects. He seems to feel inclined to give up the struggle and go away, but she is made of a sterner stuff and tries to prevent him in his intentions. As good luck would have it, the betrothal feast is to be held in the park by the seashore, and here Providence provides the accident which unites the two. The two rivals quarrel about a rose and the old gentleman settles the quarrel by saying that his daughter is to throw the rose into the water, and the one who fetches it up again shall have not only the rose but also the hand of his beautiful daughter and shall become the future owner of her magnificent castle home. In a second the young man is in the water, and while the spectators are shouting with joy he reaches the rose, which he at once offers to the fair judge.

Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific Ocean, the vessel is wrecked and all on board have been drowned, at least so the newspapers chronicled. What a blow to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, ""Robinson Crusoe,"" for he at least enjoyed the companionship of ""Friday,"" but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child. He at once concludes that he has been forgotten and his place taken by his friend. His soul is at first filled with revenge and he is about to strike Foster down, but no, she is happy. She thinks him dead, and why not let it be so? This would be the most kindly, so he slinks hack into the foliage, intending to go away forever. They pass into the house, leaving the little one playing on the lawn. He cannot resist folding his child to his heart. From her he learns the truth as the mother returns from the house, and two faithful souls are ""once more united never to part.""",1908,movie,N/A

He is persistent in his suit for her hand, but outside of a seemingly cordial friendship the lady apparently does not return his affections. There is a reason for this. Osman Bey, a Turkish nobleman, desires the hand of this charming girl. He has expressed his love for her to her father, who is an ambitious, worldly man and who aspires to obtain that social recognition which is so dear to the average man of wealth. Mons. Dupont is well aware that he is selling his daughter, and so cleverly does he arrange matters by pretending that he is facing financial ruin, that he persuades Flora into giving her consent to the marriage in order to save his credit. Several months later, whilst sightseeing in Constantinople, Jack by accident meets Flora, who is driving in a closed vehicle. He is startled at the change in her appearance and indignant over the revelation of her misery and ill-treatment. Almost a prisoner in the house of Osman Bey, she is denied friends and relatives. Her one great desire now is to get away from her tyrannical and brutal husband. Jack determines to aid her, and tells her that he will gain admittance to the grounds of the palace after sundown, where he may talk with her and if possible formulate a plan whereby she may gain her freedom. True to his word Jack is on hand at the appointed time, but is unable to pass the guards at the gate. Nothing daunted, this daring American determines to scale the massive walls, which he does after a great deal of difficulty. Making his way through the beautiful gardens, he manages to see through a lighted window Flora's face and form, Gently tapping on the pane of glass her attention is attracted, but a female spy, ordered by Osman Bey to keep an eye on his wife, observes the signal from the window and immediately acquaints her master with the knowledge of his wife's indiscretion. Burning with rage, the infuriated husband summons his slaves and orders them to take the American prisoner. Jack has just greeted Flora, when he is startled by a sharp word of command, and turning suddenly he is seized by the stalwart slaves of the palace and dragged away. Flora appeals to her enraged husband for Jack's release, taking all the blame on herself, but to no avail. The prisoner is carried to an underground dungeon, where he is left to ponder over the perplexing situation in which he now finds himself. Maddened by grief, the poor girl determines in her desperation to go to the Sultan and beg his clemency. Escaping from her chamber window she makes her way to the Sultan's palace, and gaining admittance is granted an audience by his majesty. Struck by her beauty and fired by the crafty thought that he might gain this helpless woman for his harem, he promises her the pardon, but instead of letting her take it he dispatches one of his officers with the papers, at the same time commanding the bewildered Flora to remain at his palace. How Jack is led out to execution and how the pardon arrives just in time to save his life, much to the chagrin of Osman Bey, is all vividly shown. Jack has learned of Flora's detention in the Sultan's palace, and so embittered is he at this outrage that he joins the cause of the revolutionists. The last scenes of the picture show the attack on the Sultan's palace, and the meeting of Osman Bey and Jack in a hand to hand conflict in which the Turk is bested, which is followed by the rescue of Flora and the capture of the despised Sultan.",1909,movie,N/A

Still, she has found that all is not gold that glitters, and while her artistic success is most agreeable, life for her is empty, cold and cheerless, made more odious by the appearance of the inevitable vile, flattering tempter. Numerous letters has she written to her dear old father, but no response, for he has torn them into shreds before he even broke the seal. ""Oh, God, if I could only go back. If this all would prove but a dream."" But, no, there is the dark fathomless future before her. The tempter would have her go with him, and there seems to be no alternative. She is now surely at the crossroads of life. She makes a final appeal to her father in a telegram begging him to come to see her performance on the night following, which he does. Down the aisle of the theater comes the old minister in bewilderment, so unaccustomed is he to the surroundings, as through the peekhole in the curtain drops the girl views the scene in ecstasy. After the performance the old man makes his way to the back of the stage, where he once more folds his daughter to his heart, while her would-be lover views the scene with unconcealed chagrin. The story is a most touching one.",1908,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA0MjY4NDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg1MDA4Mg@@.jpg
0000641,Balked at the Altar,"Short,Comedy",United States,us,N/A,N/A,4.7,166,"Artemisia Sophia Stebbins was a lovelorn maiden who had delved deep into the mysteries of ""Three Weeks,"" as well as being conversant with the teachings of Laura Jean Libby. Her one hobby was to possess a hubby. Many there were whom she tried to hook, but in vain, for truth to say. Arte was of pulchritude a bit shy. She had the complexion of pale rhubarb and a figure like a wheat sack. Still her motto was ""nil desperandum,"" and she was ever hopeful. One thing in her favor, her father. Obediah Stebbins, avowed his aid. Of the visitors who called at the Stebbins' domicile, Hezekiah Horubeak seemed the most probable to corral, so Artemisia set to work. Hez at first was a trifle recalcitrant, but was soon subdued by Obediah's gun, which we must admit possessed egregious powers of persuasion. The day for the wedding was set, and to the village church there flocked the natives to witness this momentous affair. All was progressing serenely until the all-important question was put to Hezekiah, and instead of answering ""Yea,"" he kicked over the trace and tried to beat it. His escape by way of the door was intercepted, so it happens that the little church is in sore need of a stained glass window, for Hez took a portion of it with him in his haste. Out and over the lawn he gallops with the congregation at his heels, Artemisia Sophia well in the lead. Down from the terrace onto the road they leap and across the meadow until they come to a fence, on the other side of which are two boys shooting crap. Over this hurdle they vault coming plump down on the poor boys, almost crushing the life out of them. Regaining his equilibrium, Hez forges on coming to the very acropolis of the town. The descent therefrom is decidedly precipitous and makes Hez hesitate for a moment, but only a moment, for the howling horde is still in pursuit, so down be goes in leaps and falls to the bottom, followed by a veritable avalanche of human beings. Owing to this mix-up Hez has a chance to distance them a little, and being almost exhausted, he attempts to climb a tree, but too late for the gang is soon upon him, and carry him back to the church where the ceremony is started again, and when he is asked that all-important question he fairly yells, ""Yes, b'gosh!"" Artemisia is now asked the question, and to the amazement of all present she says, ""Not on your county fair tintype,"" and flounces haughtily out of the church, leaving poor Hezekiah in a state of utter collapse, surrounded by sympathizing friends.",1908,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiNjhiN2MtNDY0Ny00OTJhLWI4YTYtYmY5ZTRmNzBhYzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU3NjUzNTc@.jpg

The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening.",1908,movie,N/A

One, Miss Myrtle Vane, is having wretched luck and Mrs. Wharton advises her several tomes to desist, but she plays on in the vain hope of fortune's tide turning, until finally, in extreme desperation, she stakes her all--and loses. Shame and disgrace stare her in the face. What can she do to recoup her depleted fortune? Another guest is eminent palmist Professor Francois Paracelsus, who of course, was called upon to read the palms of those present. Sheets of paper were prepared and each imprinted their hand on a sheet to be read by the erudite soothsayer at his leisure, so were left on the drawing room table. All have now retired to the apartments assigned them by Mrs. Wharton, but there seems to be a sleepless night before Myrtle, and she suffers mental agony until the thought of the necklace flashes before her mind's eye--if she only possessed those treasures all would be well. The more she thought of it the more unconquerable became her covetousness, until the inimitable determination to secure them seized her, but how? To enter her room by the door would not only arouse the hostess, but maybe the guests as well. There was but one way, by the window, and this undertaking was decidedly hazardous, for it meant that she must crawl along the narrow ledge between her window and that of Mrs. Wharton, a distance of 20 feet, and one slight misstep would result in her being dashed to death on the walk below. But she makes the trip without mishap, and entering the room she searches noiselessly for the top of the dresser, finds it, secures the necklace, and makes her way back to her apartment. Now to hide the jewels. An ingenious idea strikes her. She cuts in two a bar of soap, and hollowing it out, places the treasure inside and joins the parts together. Meanwhile Mrs. Wharton, aroused from her slumber, intuitively looks to her diamonds, but finds them gone. ""What's this? A clue!"" On the dresser there is a sheet of the palmister's paper on which there is a handprint of dust. Down to the drawing room for the corresponding imprint. There it is, and signed ""Myrtle Vane."" To Miss Vane's room goes the furious Mrs. Wharton, and during the scene that transpires the soap is brushed from the table and breaks open, exposing the necklace, at the same time convicting the poor girl. Upon the recovery of her jewels, Mrs. Wharton's anger subsides and she is inclined to be charitable towards the unfortunate girl kneeling at her feet, so she not only forgives her, but insists upon aiding her financially.",1908,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg3ZmZkMGYtOThlOC00ZDFhLWEyYWQtNWQ3OGE3NjQyYjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@.jpg

'Tis the opening night of a big production at the opera house, and at eight o'clock we still find the distracted actress in her humble apartment bending over the wan figure of her little one, while her own mother stands by in mute distress. A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.",1908,movie,N/A

The little one asks her mother if Santa Clans is coming, to which the poor, almost heartbroken woman is unable to answer. The baby then says, ""I'll write him a letter to be sure to come."" And so she writes on a scrap of paper, ""Dear Santa, please don't forget little Margie. Me and mamma ain't got no food even. Little Margie, 114 Broome St., top floor.""

Brown enters, and taking off his coat goes to the closet to hang it up, and it looks for the moment that a discovery is inevitable, so Wells sneaks from there, and after ineffectually seeking a place of safety for some minutes, is finally caught. He throws suspicion on poor Mrs. Brown, who in vain tries to convince her husband the fellow is a thief. Finally the husband hands her a pistol and commands her to shoot her lover, or thief, whichever he be. This the wife is loath to do, but as Wells raises a gun and is about to shoot her husband, she sends a bullet through his wrist, dropping the gun from his hand. At this moment a couple of policemen, who had heard the skirmish, rush in and secure Wells, in whose pockets are found many articles of value, proving conclusively his true character. Brown now shamefacedly implores the forgiveness of his wife for his suspicious.",1908,movie,N/A

But, alas! he is human, and in his employ is a very beautiful girl as model. This girl has loved her employer with a suppressed, hopeless passion, which needed but a breath to fan it into a blaze. In justice to her it must be said that she didn't realize the strength of this feeling, smothering it with admiration for the artist's devotion for his wife. Ah, but the Devil knows how to play the game, and his promptings are so fascinatingly impressive that few can resist. But who is the Devil? He is the embodiment of our evil inclination warring with the pure. So it was that at his prompting the artist falls, as does his model. They are discovered by the wife, who in turn is prompted by the Devil to ""get even,"" which she heeds. She is surprised by her husband in a private dining-room of a café in company with a gentleman friend. In frenzy he leaps at his wife's throat, and the Devil laughs. He would have sent her to him then and there, hut for the intervention of the waiters. In terror, the poor woman rushes to her home. She is followed by the crazed husband. In vain she pleads, but the Devil prompts: ""Kill."" Taking a revolver from the dresser-drawer, he moves deliberately toward the terrified wife, and the Devil laughs. A shot and a body and soul part; another shot, and ""There was the Devil to pay,"" and he collected.

Pong writes Hendricks that he has need for five young girls, and so Hendricks sets out to secure them. Visiting a rural district, he has no trouble, by his glib, affable manner, in gaining the confidence of several young and pretty girls. Pong is on hand with a closed carriage to bag the prey. One of the girls, as she is seized, emits a yell that alarms the neighborhood and brings to the scene several policemen and a couple of detectives, who have long been on the lookout for these caitiffs. The Chinese get away with the carriage, however, and Hendricks by subterfuge throws the police on the wrong scent. One of the detectives is a woman, and possessed of shrewd powers of deduction, hence does not swallow the bald story of the villain, and exercises her natural acumen with success. She shadows Hendricks, and by means of a flirtation inveigles him to a restaurant, where she succeeds in doping his drink. He falls asleep and she secures the letter written by Pong, which discloses the hiding place of the Chinaman. This she immediately telephones to the police, and while so doing Hendricks awakes and starts off to warn his friends. He arrives at the old deserted house ahead of the police, but escape is impossible, so the police rescue the girls, but fail to secure Pong and Hendricks, who afterwards seize the girl detective, and taking her to the house, tie her to a post and arrange a large pistol on the face of a clock in such a way that when the hands point to twelve the gun is fired and the girl will receive the charge. Twenty minutes are allowed for them to get away, for the hands are now indicating 11:40. Certain death seems to be her fate, and would have been had not an accident disclosed her plight. Hendricks after leaving the place is thrown by a street car, and this serves to discover his identity, so he is captured and a wild ride is made to the house in which the poor girl is incarcerated.

She comes timidly forward. Bambard rises to his feet, staggers toward her in a half-drunken manner, points to her full basket of flowers, roughly pushes her and orders her out again. She sinks exhausted on a chair and pleads for a rest, but Bambard strikes her and forces her out the door. The two thieves resume their conversation, and after a while gather some burglar tools, leaving mother Martin, another member of the gang, in charge and depart. The flower girl wanders along to a fashionable part of the city, meeting with but little success in disposing of her flowers. An automobile dashes up, and Rene Masson, a handsome young man, alights. Mimi offers him a bunch of flowers. He looks at her face, takes them and gives in return several bank notes.

Bambard and Pigord, who have been watching from across the street, start off in the same direction. The young man reaches his apartments, carries in the unconscious girl and places her on a couch. Forcing some wine between her lips, the girl soon revives and opens her eyes in wonderment. She is given food and drink, recovers from her faintness and asks to go. Her protector accompanies her and they have scarcely left the room when Bambard and Pigord enter, ransack the place, carrying away bank notes, jewels, plate, etc. They proceed to their den, tell of their escapade, also of the fainting of Mimi.

The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior. She writes to him to meet her by the Great Lamp of Savatiya that night, and they are nearly caught through the treachery of one of the butterflies of the court, who tells the Daimio of his rival. The lover escapes by hiding in the great lamp and afterwards being conveyed in a large hamper to the Bower of Roses, where he is eventually captured and thrown into the torture chamber. The Daimio, to render his revenge more complete, conveys to O Yama a false message from her lover, with his, the Daimio's, permission to see him. She is conducted to the chamber, and the sight that greets her fairly paralyzes her; for here is her lover hung by the wrists, dangling over a treacherous bed of upturned knife-blades, which inflict ugly wounds at the slightest move of his body. Besides this, there is a sword lying across a fire to be used at order from the Daimio. Here the Daimio gives poor O Yama her choice between her marriage with him or her lover's torture. But the brave warrior urges her to refuse. The sword, now incandescently hot, is applied to his breast, leaving great red scars, but he is still obdurate, until at length he is cut down and expires in the arms of O Yama. As he fails, his dagger drops to the floor, and O Yama, unobserved, conceals it in her obi. Then, turning to the Daimio, she consents to become his bride. He, delighted by her apparent change of heart, orders the preparations for the wedding to be made at once, which, according to Japanese custom, is to take place just before sundown. There in the wedding hall are assembled the courtiers and butterflies, when enter the priest, or ""Marrier,"" as he is called, followed by O Yama, her mother and the Daimio. The Daimio, his bride-elect, and her mother take their places on the cushions, while the Marrier pours the sake, handing the cup first to the mother, then to the Daimio, who both drink of the wine, and finally to O Yama, who, instead of drinking, whips the dagger from her obi, plunges it deep into the heart of the Daimio, who drops like a log, dead at her feet, and before anyone can intervene she performs the happy dispatch with the same bodkin, so concluding a film story that is not only a most exciting and novel one, but extremely picturesque as well.",1908,movie,N/A

At any rate, they all feared him, as he, with them, terrorized the whole country 'round by acts of pillage, arson, and worse. Despite his black nature, Bill was a handsome fellow who, under different conditions, might be called attractive. There is reason why Nellie Carson, a girl of the frontier, should fall violently in love with him and cast her lot with his. She soon finds out his true nature, but even then she seems to be held by an irresistible power. He tries to cast her off, leaving her lying wounded and insensible in the road after a stormy scene between them. She is discovered by a girl of the mountains who offers to help her to her mountain home. Though moved by the girl's kindness, she rejects her offer, choosing to go her own way on the road of life she has chosen. The mountain girl drives off and is waylaid by Bill, who seizes her and drags her to his camp. Nellie, coming along later, discovers evidence of what has taken place, and with a feeling of pity for the girl, and jealousy of Bill, resolves to save her. She arrives at camp at nightfall and manages to release the girl and get away, but unfortunately her revolver drops to the ground, and exploding, awakens the gang. The girl's plight looks bad, and would have been disastrous had not one of the Indians, who had always shown a weakness for Nellie, handicapped Bill. This enabled the girls, who mounted the one horse, to get a lead. However, Bill and his red devils are fast gaining on them, and several of his bullets have taken effect in poor Nellie's body, who has sacrificially placed herself between the mountain girl and Bill. The girl's apprehension seems inevitable, when the Indian rides up, and Bill, with a dagger wound in the breast, falls from his horse, thereby closing his contemptible career. This in a measure demoralizes the gang, and the girls reach the mountaineer's cabin, but Nellie is mortally wounded and expires as she is taken from the horse, the good Indian driving up just in time to claim her body that he might bury it.

Jones starts in all right. He takes a fine cigar, the morning paper, selects the easiest chair in the parlor, and assumes for the nonce the air of a gentleman of leisure. But, alas, his beatific dream was rudely disturbed by Wifey: ""John, dear, I really cannot get this stovepipe back in place; it doesn't seem to fit."" Well, we know what a prolix undertaking this is. John struggled and swore, fretted and fussed, until down came the whole affair, covering him with a suit of soot from head to feet. A bath is next in order. Having divested himself of this ebony complexion, he is back in the parlor, but hardly seated, when Mrs. Jones calls him to the kitchen to fix the water pipe. He succeeds only in getting a thorough drenching, and once more a change of apparel is necessary. This being done, his wife now demands he hang a picture. ""Ah, let us alone."" But Wifey insists. A stepladder is brought in and Jones ascends it, armed with hammer and nails, with a large picture frame under his arm. The nail is held in position, and, ""Why, John!"" says Wifey, ""such language, and before baby."" John had aimed the hammer at the nail head, but hit his thumb. Another blow, more vigorous than the first, is sent, ""Gee, whiz, twice in the same place. Biddy Mulligan."" Jones, with a yell of pain, leaps in the air and there is a mad race between his head and the picture frame for the floor; it was a dead heat. Wifey is awfully sorry, and allows him to pacify and amuse himself with minding the baby, a delicate attention on her part. Still, it might be worse, and soon it is, for Wifey's voice is heard calling, ""John, dear, the gas is leaking."" Jones, with a lighted candle, goes into the cellar in search of the leak, and finds it; and when the smoke and dust of the explosion clears away, poor John is seen stretched out on the cellar floor. Oh, but what's the use? John was given a day of rest by the boss, and he rests with a vengeance.",1908,movie,N/A

Her artless rustic simplicity, rivaling Hebe's gorgeous radiance, phlogisticates the susceptible hearts of the village swains. But alas, Hulda was a fickle maid, and seemed to have as many phases as the moon, with a smile for all and a frown for none. Her capriciousness was the cause of much unrest, both for herself and her lovers, for when her parents had departed for a visit, leaving her in charge of the kitchen, she received most effusively Jocular Jake, the village cut-up, only to hide him above stairs at the entrance of Previous-Hearted Pat, the hostler, who in turn is hidden in the Dutch oven at the approach of Handy Hank, the chore boy. Now Hank has long loved the fair Hulda, but, gol darn it, somehow or other he just can't tell her, and so he puts it off. The next to arrive is Asinine Alfred, the city chap. He makes quite a hit, but again an interruption sends him unwillingly to the wood box. ""Drat it all!"" It is only Hank with an armful of wood, which he throws in on the unfortunate Alfred. The worst is not yet, for in walks Generous George, the grocer's clerk, who is the beau ideal of the village; so he thinks. Again that tantalizing interruption.

No indeed! He would have procured some of the mysterious fluid compounded by an erudite scientist by which things animate and inanimate were rendered non est, for ten minutes at least, by simply spraying them with it. In an atomizer, he sends a quantity, accompanied by a letter, to his brother. In the hope of his putting it on the market. The brother regards it as a joke, and, while toying with the atomizer, accidentally sprays himself. Presto! he is gone, to the amazement of the messenger boy who has carried the package thither. The boy reads the letter, and at once sees the amount of fun he can get out of it, so he nips it. Strolling along the avenue is a young girl, leading a dog by a chain. Swish! and a dangling chain is all that is left with the girl. Next, a Dago with a fruit stand: first, the fruit stand is made to disappear, then the Dago himself.

He is now chased by a mob of his victims, who have by this time overcome the influence of the fluid and become reincarnate. Halting on the road, he turns on his pursuers and effects their disappearance one after another as they approach him.

0000712,King of the Cannibal Islands,"Short,Comedy",United States,us,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"""Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast."" Not always, but sometimes. Hence it was that the dulcet tones produced by Heinie Holtzmeyer, the fiddler, and Orpheus of the little Holland Village, failed to tranquilize his wife Lena, who was rather a Xantippe than an Eurydice, and Heinie's head, like that of Socrates, often played the target for her pots and pans, and her aim was very good. The poor fellow sought solace at the public house, where he met the toss-pots of the town, and right merry souls were they. His fiddle made him a favorite with all, especially the barmaids, who rewarded his efforts with wine and kisses. His joys, however, are of short duration, for Lena appears, and, brandishing a rolling-pin, clears out the place. Heinie rushes home, packs his bag and, with his fiddle, decamps. He is followed by Lena until he reaches the wharf, where he finds himself, as it were, ""between the devil and the deep sea,"" so he chooses the sea. Jumping into a row-boat he rows to an outgoing vessel, ships and is off for parts unknown. A storm is encountered, and the vessel is wrecked, but fortune favors and he is cast ashore. Heinie is about to give thanks for his deliverance when he is pounced upon by an army of ferocious cannibals, armed with clubs and excaliburs, now wouldn't that discombobulate you? Well, it looked like Stew à la Hollandaise for Heinie. And indeed, the black warriors are about to prepare a Dutch dinner, when the Queen does the Pocahontas act and, throwing herself on the prostrate form of Heinie, declares that they shall strike him only through her. So they desist, for such a thing would be impossible, as the Queen is so thick through, that the longest spear would hardly reach the victim. In fact, she is that obese she looks like a crowd. Heinie now takes his fiddle and discourses sweet music, which places him in such high esteem with the tribe that be experiences his own apotheosis, besides becoming the husband of the Queen and King of the islands. Lena, after three years of relentless endeavor, discovers his whereabouts, and bursts in unannounced upon his sunny serenity. Aha! Here is his chance to set even, and as she had kept him in hot water at Holland, he does as much for her now: hence, he consigns her to the stewpot. Moral: the worm will turn.",1908,movie,N/A

At the parish church the worshipers are observed leaving, among them Magistrate Lorenz. Father Herman and Madalene, a charming young girl whom Lorenz has chosen as the wife of his son Rudolph. They proceed to the home of Lorenz, where Rudolph is observed seated on a bench, meditating. The young man is upbraided by the father for his failure to attend religious services, and while in conversation Leah appears, closely followed by the angry mob. The crowd makes a rush toward her, the priest raises the cross before them and they cower in fear. Beneath a large cross in the forest, Leah is waiting expectantly. Rudolph appears and the lovers, for such they are, rush into each other's arms. The young man asks Leah to marry him and leave home. She promises, and after vowing eternal fidelity the lovers part, agreeing to meet the following day at the same place and from there leave for other parts. Nathan, an apostate Jew, has stolen in behind the pair during their conversation, hears all and gleefully departs unnoticed. He proceeds directly to the home of the magistrate and tells of Rudolph's love for the Jewess. Lorenz is furious, will not believe the tale, and bids Nathan begone. At this time Rudolph appears, and being asked for the truth, haughtily admits his love for Leah. The old magistrate is heartbroken, and he and Nathan decide to buy off Leah with gold. Although indignant, Rudolph consents to have her love tested. Nathan leaves with the large purse of gold and shortly comes upon her. He offers her the purse which she angrily throws to the ground and indignantly leaves him. Nathan stands for the moment perplexed, then puts the gold in his own pocket, takes the empty purse, returns in the house, and shows the purse minus the gold. The father and his associates are overjoyed, while Rudolph is heartbroken. The next day at the appointed time Leah goes to the forest and waits anxiously for Rudolph. As time passes on and he does not appear, she falls to the ground in bitter grief at his supposed unfaithfulness. At his home Rudolph is heartbroken over what he thinks her falsity. He goes inside warily with his father, and presently Leah approaches the house, knocks at the door and begs to speak to Rudolph. The father orders her away. Rudolph appears in the doorway, starts upon seeing Leah, and angrily bids her depart. Leah does not understand his changed manner and pleads with him. Rudolph denounces her, then passes inside, leaving the Jewess in agony on the steps. Preparations for the marriage of Madalene to Rudolph are quickly made and they repair to the church for the ceremony. Leah creeps up to the door and hides as the party enters. She watches the ceremony, and as the villagers leave the church, falls in a faint. Again at the cross in the forest Rudolph is as Leah appears before him. She upbraids him for his faithlessness, while he shows the empty purse and accuses her. She at last comprehends the situation and indignantly denies having taken the money. Rudolph also sees the mistake, falls to his knees and asks for pardon. Leah haughtily turns away, tells of her suffering, and, bitterly abusing him, departs. Five years elapse, and outside Rudolph's home he and Madalene and their little child are seated. Leah comes upon the little girl and kisses the child lovingly. The villagers come upon the pair and jeer at the Jewess. The noise brings Rudolph and Madalene from the house, and Leah points to Nathan, the leader of the mob, denounces him as an apostate Jew, a thief and the instigator of her unhappiness. Rudolph shows the empty purse, justifying the charge. Nathan is taken in hand by officers and dragged away. Leah staggers, then falls dead at Rudolph's feet.",1908,movie,N/A

A bitter war is waging between two kingdoms, and as the King and Queen hold court in the throne room of the palace there arrives a courier, who, battered and exhausted, has scarcely strength as he falls at the foot of the throne to thrust into the hands of the anxious King, a message which tells of the disaster and panic that has befallen his forces. The King immediately holds council of war and calls for a trusty messenger to carry to his armies the reassuring intelligence that reinforcements have been rushed to their aid. The lot falls to a brave young courier, lion-hearted and with nerve of steel, who, before setting off, goes to take leave of his sweetheart. He discovers her resenting the unwelcomed advances of his rival, a contemptible scoundrel. The villain departs, swearing vengeance, and shadows the hero as he rides off. The sweetheart, on horseback follows to warn her lover of his danger. Now the villain, with the aid of his mistress, who has arranged a meeting by letter, dupes the hero by lying in the road, pretending she is wounded. The hero dismounts to assist her, and is stabbed in the back by the villain, who had hidden in the bush. He secures the message and they make for a neighboring inn, leaving the hero lying in the road, where he is found later by his sweetheart and her attendants. The lover is cared for by his sweetheart and some kindly farm folk, and the attendants are hastened to bring guards. The letter to the villain is found in the road, which indicates his whereabouts, and they repair to the inn where the villain is surprised and arrested. Recovering the message, the hero hastens on to the army. With renewed vigor the opposing forces are repelled and the day won.

So the trains, of which there was but one a day, are never on time. To the station there comes a coterie of weary travelers, all possessed with a wild desire to put a long distance between Lonesome Junction and the backs of their necks. As usual, the train is six hours late, and you may imagine the party is in not a very amiable humor. The first to arrive is an Englishman, who is ""jolly well"" vexed at the condition of affairs. ""Train six hours late! Hit's a blooming h'outrage, don't you know!"" He leaves his suit case in the sway of others coming in, and a wealthy mine owner, who enters at that moment, falls sprawling. The next to enter is a prize-fighter, who in turn takes a tumble. Wow! It looks as if there is going to be ""something doing,"" when the driver of the Pony Express enters with the mail bag, and tells Mr. Pug to sit down and behave. He sits and lights his pipe, still chewing the rag. The driver clips the pipe out of his mouth with a pistol shot and makes him dance to the music of his gun play. This holds Mr. Pug for an indefinite period. The party is now increased by the arrival of Heinrich Spitzelperger. ""Vas ist das; sex stunden zu warten ? Oh, vell, I haf a smoke."" Heine has pipe and tobacco, but no match. ""Please, you haf a match, no?"" Well, it looks as if he don't smoke. At this point the door opens and in rushes one of those hypochondriacal phisanthropists, a Black Hand Dago. A hyena is a playful kitten compared with him. Opening his satchel, he takes out a large bomb, lights the fuse and places it on the window shelf of the ticket office. The pugilist is the first to notice his action and yells, ""Beat it!"" which they surely do, all except Heine, who is seated on a bench still searching through his pockets in hopes of finding a match hidden therein. Espying the smoking fuse of the bomb, he picks it up, ignorant of the danger, lights his pipe and failing to extinguish it, drops it into a fire pail none too soon, for the moment it strikes the water it explodes, blowing Heine off his feet. When the party returns they find him suffering no further injury than badly shattered nerves. While relating his experience there enters a most beautiful young lady. ""Observe who is in our midst,"" says one, and a more chivalrous bunch you never saw; all anxious to serve her. She states that her baggage is outside, so Mr. Pug insists that ""I'm de boy wit de strong arm."" He carries in several grips and finally a trunk as big as a cottage, which completely does him up, and though there is still another trunk, he is not equal to it. Now Heine gives an exhibition of brain vs. brawn, and instead of shouldering the trunk, wheels it in on a hand truck, much to the amusement of the party at the expense of the pugilist. They are all now in high spirits when there appears in the doorway a tough road agent With most forbidding mien he points a revolver and commands them to line up and put their valuables on the floor in front of him. Heine, unobserved by the bad man, drops down behind the trunk and when the thug's back is turned, sticks a gun behind his ear and tells him to drop his firearm on the top of the trunk. Hurrah for Heine, the hero! But he forgets the thug may have another gun, and in the unguarded moment he whips out another and is about to push daylight through Dutchy when the express driver from outside sends a bullet through the bad boy's wrist. The arrival of the belated train is announced, and the party scramble out of the station, in a mad rush to get aboard.",1908,movie,N/A

Of the thousands who daily witness moving picture exhibitions, the number who have any conception of the manner of making a picture is comparatively small. Therefore, to the majority this picture will prove a genuine novelty. It opens in the private office of the Vitagraph Company, where the manuscript is being carefully considered. The studio directors enter, receive their instructions, proceed to the studio, get out the cameras, give orders about scenery, props, etc. Then we get a view of the Vitagraph actors and actresses making up for their different characters. All preparations finished, the Vitagraph automobiles line up. The performers get in and proceed to the scene of operation, which happens to be, in this instance, a busy city thoroughfare. A trolley is held up, numerous little by-plays, not in the lines, occur to add variety and interest to the picture. This scene over, all hands return to the studio, where we see a stupid actor being put through his work. Next a view is given of the quick lunch counter in the Vitagraph plant. Following this, the studio scenes are rehearsed and photographed, showing all the necessary paraphernalia for the different effects required, as well as the rapidity with which scenes are struck and made ready by the stage hands. The picture finally finished is taken to the testing room, where we see it projected. The Story: ""Love Is Better than Riches."" A young soldier and his sweetheart are sitting in the parlor of the girl's home. The young man proposes and is accepted. The young lady's father enters, is furious when he hears of the engagement, and orders the young man out of the house. He goes, taking his sweetheart with him. They hurry to a church, are married and return to her home. The couple tells the father of their marriage. The old man is beside himself with rage and turns them out into the street. Their start in life is humble, but their home is happy, while that of the father is lonely. The next scene shows the girl and her soldier husband walking along the street. The young man leaves his wife for a moment, when an automobile dashes along, knocking her down. The auto is owned by her father. The old man gets out, recognizes his daughter and wants to take charge of her when the husband appears, waves him aside and takes his wife to their home.

This became more torturing as time went on, until at last, when the bank was arranging to ship a large quantity of cash to the West to relieve the recent money stringency, he made up his mind to heed the solicitude of that specter which had haunted him. Listening to the instructions given to the bank's messenger as to the shipment of the funds, he hustles off to a gang of crooks in whose company he had fallen. He tells of the proposed shipment, what express, what time and where to. They are not long in devising a plan, and a most clever one at that. A large coffin box is procured and one of the parties is to be fastened in it in such a way that he can release himself at the proper time. This is to be shipped on the same train and to the same place as the funds, the others of the gang to go as passengers. Next a man is selected to go into the box. This is done by drawing from a pack of cards; the one getting the Ace of Spades is elected. By fatal fortuity it falls to the bank clerk. In he goes and is shipped off. The coffin box and the express strong box containing the funds are now seen reposing in the express room of a lonely Western station. It is past midnight and the last train has gone through. The station agent, making himself secure for the night, so he thinks, starts to eat his lunch in the next room. Slowly and noiselessly the top of the coffin box raises and out comes the man. With pistol in hand, he stealthily approaches the agent from behind. His first intention is to shoot, but, no, this would arouse the village. A blow on the head with the butt of the gun brings the agent to the door like a log. The door is locked. From the agent's pocket he gets the key, opens the door and signals to the crooks who are in waiting. They enter and at once start to break open the box by drilling and blasting the cover. Meanwhile, the agent, who was only stunned by the blow, crawls to his telegraph instrument and sends out a help signal. A terrific explosion and the iron box is opened, but, as they are taking out the coveted cash, they are surprised by the arrival of the railroad men, overpowered and taken into custody.",1908,movie,N/A

John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. God's mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys. Tom and Gladys grew up together, and were child sweethearts, which grew stronger with Gladys as time went on. So deeply did she love the handsome Tom that she put her entire trust in him, feeling sure that he would reciprocate her sacrificial devotion with the honorable obligation it merited. But, oh, how mistaken she was, and only after prayers and tearful entreaties does he agree to marry her, and then only upon condition that she elope. To this she consents most reluctantly, for which act she is disowned by her parents. The villainy that is wrapped up in the black heart of Tom. Truly a marriage ceremony is performed, but it is by a rowdy friend of Tom's, disguised as a clergyman, in fact, a mock marriage. For a time Gladys lived in ignorance of the truth, but it at last came out when Tom deserts her. Back to her home she trudged carrying her infant, and at the door she is met by her mother with open arms but when the father appears, he, still obdurate, drives her away.

The date of the tragedy, or rather the discovery, was early Summer of 1828, just eighty-two years ago. Wm. Corder, a young farmer, is engaged to be married to a wayward young woman, Maria Martin, and he calls on her at her home and makes an appointment for her to meet him in male attire at the old Red Barn. Finding that he is to be disinherited by his wealthy parents if he persists in his marriage with this girl, and being in fear of the consequences of not marrying her, from her brothers and father, he lures her to this lonely spot, where he has gone before and dug an improvised trench. The frantic efforts of the girl to get from his clutches and escape with her life are shown, and finally the actual murder. Wm. Corder then leaves the vicinity, and writes several times to the parents of Maria Martin how happy they are together. The mother of Maria is taken very ill, and during the course of her illness is seized with delirium, in which a dream appears, vividly portraying the actual scene of the crime. This scene is so vivid and realistic that she pleads with the officer to investigate, when the matter is discovered and Corder is brought to justice.",1908,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTg4NmUzZDMtMWExOC00ODNlLTg5YmQtZDcwYjE5ZDkxOGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDgyNjA5MA@@.jpg

Sunday night is a most busy one for the coppers, and the cooler on Monday morning is jammed with a fascinated mob of law breakers.

He is awfully brutal to Clarence, and snatches the cigarette from his mouth, hurling, yes hurling it to the floor, curse him! The Judge has a large gavel with which he calls the court to order; also using it upon occasions on the heads of the learned attorneys, when they become too demonstrative. The first prisoner to be tried is Happy Hooligan.

Such is the sad fate of the hero of this Biograph story. Herr Von Mitzel, a disciple of Antonio Stradivari, fell deeply in love with his pupil, the daughter of a wealthy English lord. His love was returned by the fair young maid, who grieved at the disparity of their rank, and wished that he had been more highly born or she more lowly. Oh, the tyranny of fate! What discouraging conditions were brought to bear upon their affections; but true love can no more be diminished by showers of evil-hap than flowers are marred by timely rains; so the conspiring circumstances tended rather to strengthen than to weaken their passion. Now, in the Winter of his existence, we find Von Mitzel alone and forlorn. His only companion and solace is his faithful violin, the strains of which are more eloquent than melodious, conjuring up as they do the recollections of life's Spring-time. We picture him seated at his cheerless fireside, playing his, or rather her favorite selection, and as the sweet tones float out upon the silent night, there appears on the wall a phantasmagorical portrayal of his thoughts, which bring him back to days of yore. The image of his inamorata is first seen; then the lesson on the harpsichord, when he declares his love; next the scene of her being forced by her parents into an odious marriage compact; then a duel with his rival, in which he is wounded. The scene dissolves into the reappearance of the girl. The subject is most beautiful and touching and is sure to win the sympathetic approval of the spectator, besides being a work of photographic excellence.",1908,movie,N/A

Hence it was that the mere mention of his name sent terror to the hearts of the stage drivers of the mountains. Many were the wonderful tales told at the relay inns along the stage route that made the tourists shudder with fear as they resumed their course westward. Dick Stanley was one of the nerviest drivers on the stage line and had, as yet, escaped molestation from Jack, Dick was deeply in love with Mollie, the innkeeper's daughter, but, as our story opens, they quarrel and fall out. At this moment along rides Jack, who, of course, is unknown to Mollie. He asks for a drink from the well beside which the girl stands. The bright, cheerful countenance of Mollie makes a decided impression upon Jack, and it is needless to say that the handsome young bandit, well, it is a case of love at first sight. Jack drives off, and Dick, who has watched the proceedings from a distance, approaches to acquaint her of Jack's real being. She takes no heed of Dick, but is still gazing fondly at the fast fading vision of Jack so Dick mounts his stage box and is off. The stage arrives at a lonesome turn in the road when Jack jumps from the brush and, covering Dick with his gun, orders him to dismount, the passengers to get out and give up their valuables, placing them in a handkerchief, which he makes Dick spread on the ground. Having trimmed them, he orders them back into the coach and Dick to drive off. Then he gathers up and makes off with the booty. Dick drives around back to the inn, gives the alarm, and a posse of mounted cowboys start out after the outlaw. Jack, driven by the pursuing party to the top of a precipitous cliff, deserting his horse, climbs, or rather tumbles, down over the rocks, badly cutting and bruising himself as he goes. Reaching the bottom, he runs through the woods and comes upon Mollie who hides him in the well just in time to elude the pursuers who drive up. She sends them off in the wrong direction, and, when they have gone, assists Jack out of the well, binds up his wounded head with a strip of linen torn from her skirt and gives him her horse, on which he escapes. The cowboys soon find they are on the wrong scent and return just in time to see Jack galloping like mad down the open trail. Here follows a most exciting chase, showing some marvelous horsemanship. Jack has distanced them, but his horse runs lame, and he makes a heroic dash on foot towards a barn. Failing to open the lower doors, he climbs up on a rope to the second story, pulls up the rope and closes the door. The posse now arrives, and a fusillade of bullets is sent at the door, which Jack retaliates, laying out a couple of the party. They at length set fire to the barn, and Jack is forced out through the back, and, as he leaps, a well-directed bullet from Dick's gun sends him reeling to the ground, just as Mollie, who has followed the chase on horseback, dashes up, dismounts and takes Jack's head in her arms only to find him dead.",1908,movie,N/A

We first find him begging on the street; a young girl passes and drops her purse, which the miser picks up. When she returns to regain it he knocks her insensible and makes off. Finding a generous roll of notes in the purse, he goes to the bank to have them exchanged for gold coin. A couple of thugs witness the transaction and are at once infected by the money fever. They follow the miser to his home, the cellar, and while he sleeps they break in and are securing the money when he awakes. They pounce upon him and he is made to pay the penalty of his greed with his life. The thugs go to their own squalid hovel, which is presided over by an old hag. She is sent from the room and they divide the spoils. While the division is equal, each is invidious of the other's share. They retire, both possessed of the same thought, one waiting for the other to fall asleep. One lies with a pistol in hand; the other with a dagger. At length one gets up to stab the other, but receives a bullet in his breast. With a mighty effort he plunges the dagger into the heart of his adversary and both fall over dead. The shot brings in the old hag, who, finding them both dead, seizes their loot and in a frenzy pours it out upon the table.

He tries his best to cheer his wife, and as he bids her and the baby a fond adieu in the morning on his departure for the fields, he begs her to be hopeful; better conditions are in store. Scarcely has he crossed the threshold when Roland appears at the window. This decides her; so taking her wedding ring from her finger and leaving a note of farewell, she elopes with the serpent. At that moment the sister enters, sees the note and determines to save her at any cost. Donning her riding bloomers, armed with a revolver, she leaps on a horse and dashes wildly after them, they having escaped in a phaeton. On, on they go at breakneck speed, both holding the distance between them, until the harness breaks on the horse of the elopers and they resort to a rowboat to get across the river. Down comes the sister, and leaping from her horse, dashes to the landing, and with the aid of her gun enlists the services of the old boatman to row in pursuit. Masking her face, that her identity will be unknown, she fires at the fleeing couple, causing them to heave to. Coming abreast, and flourishing the gun, she compels Roland to leap overboard and swim off. Then she commands the wife to board her boat, and at the landing, to return home. Here she makes herself known, and in a struggle the wife gets possession of the gun, when in rushes Roland and seizing the sister is choking her, when kin asserts itself in the wife and she sends a bullet crashing through Roland's arm, who at the point of the gun is driven from the place.

Having successfully perpetuated one of their nefarious exploits, they are struck by a storm and forced to put out from their floundering vessel in a small yawl, in which they place a chest of valuables, for the shore. Thrown up on the coast by the voluminous waves, they disembark; there are three of them, the chief and two underlings. Taking the chest to a place of safety, they proceed to divide the spoils. A contention arises, and the two turn on their chief, who strikes down one of them at once, but is stabbed in the back by the other, whom he afterwards strangles. Gathering up the treasure, he struggles along, his life's blood oozing from the wound inflicted by the mutinous pirate, until he comes to the cottage of Wilkinson. A terrific storm is still raging and the poor old mother is trying to shut out the force of the gale when the chief staggers in.

One seems to have had things her own way for a time, having been cast always for the leading roles, which opportunities made her the ""public's pet."" However, she does not wear the mantle of fame becomingly, for her success has made her petulant, peevish and selfish. On the other hand, her rival works studiously, and by her subtle art has won some attention, until during a performance of ""Darkest Russia"" she completely eclipses the histrionic luster of the hitherto favorite. In the Ballroom Scene (which is one of the most novel and pretentious ever staged in motion pictures) she simply carries all before her, eliciting thunderous applause and bravos of an enthusiastic audience, and the admiration of the pariahs and hoi pollois of the company. The curtain is raised again and again on the scene of her triumph, until she is called forward and a shower of floral tributes bestowed upon her. As may be imagined, this is viewed with cringing odium by her rival, who proceeds to the dressing-room, convulsed with rage, where the maid does her best to soothe her. At this moment the new star enters; her beautiful visage more radiant than the resplendent flowers with which she is laden. The offering of some of the blossoms to her companion, who has endeavored to suppress her passion, is the precursor of a stormy scene. The rage of jealousy fires her soul, and the recrudescent dethroned queen pounces upon the invidious bouquets, tearing them to shreds. What follows must be left to your imagination in this description, as it is simply indescribable, and must be seen to be appreciated.

Three thousand years ago there dwelt in Egyptian Memphis, the ancient capital of the Pharaohs, a wealthy prince, whose wife in beauty was likened to Athor, the Egyptian Venus, with heart as cold as Egyptian marble. The prince, worried and suspicious, seeks the royal seer, who tells him the princess has a lover, and in a vision shows him the princess in the arms of that lover, a Theban warrior. Instant death is the punishment meted out to the guilty pair. The princess is placed on a bier and carried out in front of the Temple, under the very shadow of the Pyramids of Gizeh. Here the High Priest, with a flambeau, sets fire to the pyre and her body is burned as an offering, with prayers, to mighty Osiris, beseeching that he overcome Typhon, who seems to hold sway. Alongside the pyre is placed a vase, decorated with hieroglyphics, which is to be the sarcophagus of that ethereal of the unfortunate princess. The smoke and vapor, as it arises from the body, enters the vase in a most mysterious manner. The vase is then sealed and the cavalcade proceeds with it to the tomb, where it is deposited and the door of the tomb closed, it was thought forever. Three thousand years later there came to the ""Land of Ruins"" a Boston professor, student of the illustrious Jean Francois Chainpollion, discoverer of the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics who unearthed the vase and took it to his home in Boston. Vague, indeed, was the story he learned about the treasure, and while sitting in his study, cudgeling his brain to lift the veil of mystery from it, falls to sleep, and in this psychological condition imagines the maid, while dusting, knocks the vase from the tabouret on which it stands. Bursting into bits, it emits a dense vapor, from which the reincarnate princess appears. Here is trouble. Our friend, the professor, is a married man, whose better-half is a buxom, unethereal person, who doesn't believe in the ""Soul Sister"" tommyrot. She, of course, wants an explanation, which the nervous professor is unable to give, so he bolts and runs hatless out of the house, followed by the princess, both followed by Mrs. Professor. Into a restaurant he rushes, with the princes at his heels. At the restaurant, as they sit enjoying a repast, the reincarnate Theban lover appears and claims the princess. This the old professor resents and is run through by the Egyptian just as the wife enters.

Having just returned from the appraiser's office, and it being late, she puts up at the hotel for the night. In the office at Kate's arrival there is a Mexican woman who has just lost her money at Faro. At sight of Kate's gold she becomes desperate and at once plans to secure it. Kate is shown to a room, and is soon asleep with the bag of yellow nuggets reposing under her pillow. Suddenly the face of the Mexican woman is seen at the window, and she has little trouble in forcing it open. Her intrusion awakens Kate, but she overpowers her and gains the gold in the struggle. Kate manages to fire her revolver, with a view to bring aid, but all too late, for the thief makes good her escape, leaving behind on the door an incriminating mantilla, which discovers the identity of the culprit. A chase is made after the fugitive, the hotel clerk, friend of Kate's, leading the way. This poor fellow, however, is dropped in his tracks by a bullet from the woman's gun in ambush. Distancing her pursuers, the Mexican woman comes upon an Indian girl, who, with her half-breed husband, are camped alongside the river. The Red Girl bides the Mexican woman and throws the searching posse on the wrong trail. In return for the kindly act on the part of the Red Girl, the Mexican woman plies her wiles on the half-breed husband, not only taking him away, but inducing him to kill his wife. To this end they plan a torture. Binding her hands and feet, they take her to a large trunk of a dead tree, which overhangs the river, and here they hang her, like Tantalus, suspended between water and sky. With her teeth she manages to free one of her hands and with an ornament on her necklace contrives to saw the rope and drop into the water. Swimming to the shore she again meets Kate and her friends, and volunteers to become their guide in running down the miscreants, who have embarked in a canoe and are rapidly paddling down the river. Into another canoe the pursuers leap and are soon shortening the distance between themselves and the scoundrels, until at length they come up with them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensues, during which both canoes are capsized, and a terrific struggle in the water ends with the overpowering of the pair and arrest of the Mexican Jezebel. The dip in the river has evidently chilled the half-breed's ardor for the Mexican woman, for he tries to return to the Red Girl, but she repulses him, and we leave her and Kate standing on the cliff, enfolded in each other's arms, bathed in the golden rays of a setting sun.

0000748,The Red Man and the Child,"Western,Short,Action",United States,us,N/A,N/A,5.4,27,"Alongside of a beautiful mountain stream in the foothills of Colorado there camped a Sioux Indian, who besides being a magnificent type of the aboriginal American, is a most noble creature, as kind-hearted as a woman and as brave as a lion. He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp.",1908,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNhM2JjNDctMmJkNS00YjFkLTk2ZTAtZTZlNWVkMzg3Nzg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI2OTg5ODQw.jpg

Milady Bibbs has just had sent home a hat and gown, for which poor Bibbsy has to give up, but when he sees her attired in the duds, he softens, for she certainly does look stunning. All is well until she turns around when, O, horror! It is a sheath gown of a most pronounced type. ""You brazen hussy, to appear such!""

The maid of the family is in league with a crook, and the pair have plotted to rob the place. To this end the crook has written a note to the maid, telling her to signal when the coast is clear. This note falls into the hands of Bibbs, and as it is simply addressed ""Honey"" and signed ""Lovingly, Tom,"" his jealous nature at once associates it with his wife. ""Aha! Sheath gown, honey, signal from the window, meet in drawing room, lovingly, Tom. I see it all: You would deceive me, eh? We shall see!""

That season of the year when the Earth gets Old Sol's Capricornus and Sol gets the Earth's ""goat,"" is especially fascinating to youth. Such is the time of action of the Biograph's latest comedy. Tis afternoon and outside the little old schoolhouse a furious blizzard rages. The earth has donned her spotless robe of white and the landscape presents a brilliant spectacle, but pitiless Boreas lashes in whirling directions the fleecy snow, heaping it up into miniature mountain ranges. School session concluding, the youngsters come tumbling out into the snow. Romping about, snowballing and like sports are indulged in, until finally they set to work to build a snowman. Around it they dance in high glee, and at length the little revelers depart reluctantly for home, leaving the snowman in abject loneliness. ""The day has fled, and dismal night descends, casting her sable arms around the world and folding all within her sable grasp."" Then the moon, fair regent of the night, rises ghost-like from the dim horizon, shedding her silvery light across the frozen moor, and seems to mock the cheerless solitude of the icy sentinel, until the good Fairy of the Snows appears and with her mystic want imbues him with life. At this moment along comes Predatory Pete, returning from one of his nocturnal expeditions. He has just clandestinely reduced the census of a neighboring henhouse by four fat pullets, which he has in a bag slung over his shoulder. Coming suddenly upon the snow-man, he is at first startled, but soon discovers what it is, and putting his pipe in the snowman's mouth, takes out a bottle to toast his frozen majesty, when, to his amazement, the snow-man is seen puffing away on the pipe with apparent enjoyment. Aghast, he drops the bottle and chickens and dashes madly across the fields, frightened almost as white as the snow through which he flounders. The snow-man picks up the bottle and takes a swig. ""Nectar! What joy is here?"" and he drains the bottle. Here is an oddity, a snow-man with a jag. Staggering into the schoolhouse, he finds the temperature too high, so throws the stove out into snow-drifts. Overcome by the booze, he lays down in the snow to sleep it off. Early morning finds him still asleep as the school children are returning to their lessons. All have entered but Sallie Simpkins, the village romp. At Sallie's approach Mr. Snow-man awakes and frightens her almost into convulsions. She darts into the schoolhouse and convinces the teacher and scholars that the place is bewitched. Out they come, and, guided by Pete, the coon, follow the vacillating roving snow-man circumambulating over the frigid, fleecy kopjes back to the point of starting, and find him standing on the very spot where he came into being. Cautiously they approach, and, led by the coon, make a mad rush on Mr. Snowman, who from the assault crumbles and falls into a heap of ""Oh, Slush!""

Sue has a brace of pistols in her belt which Phil takes, extracting the cartridges, hands them back to her empty and harmless. Her defiant mien makes a decided impression on him, as, on the other hand, he has, by his easy, gallant manner, impressed her; besides, a part of his features, which are unconcealed by the mask, gives promise that he is a handsome fellow.

The coach, arriving at the camp, an alarm is given. and a party of miners start out for the bandits.

Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins are getting ready for an evening at the opera, and. as usual Mrs. Jenkins is tantalizingly slow in her preparations, and is almost carried out of the house by the impatient Jenkins. Baby Jenkins is very much in evidence, and requires a bribe to induce her to remain contented with the maid. This Mrs. J. furnishes in the shape of a papier-maché doggie, the head of which is removed to find its interior filled with candy. Mrs. Jenkins is inclined to deck herself out in her diamonds, and takes the case from the strong-box, but in her anxiety to appease her husband's flustering, she hurriedly kisses baby and departs, forgetting all about the jewels. They are not long in the theater before the thought of the diamonds comes to her, and the awful possible result of her carelessness. She will not rest until Mr. Jenkins takes her home. On arriving there, sure enough her worst fears are apparently confirmed. There on the desk lies the jewel case empty. Good heavens. what's to be done? No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold. there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew.

0000771,The Tavern Keeper's Daughter,"Action,Short",United States,us,N/A,N/A,5.6,23,"In the lonely wilds of Southern California there stands a rural tavern, kept by an old trapper, who had been widowed years ago; his wife leaving him a most precious legacy in the being of a pretty daughter. She was indeed the fairest flower that e'er blossomed in the land of the golden sun. At this tavern there stopped the honest, hardy miners and trappers of the neighboring country on their way to and from their claims in the mountains. A sort of a rest-up place for a chat and a smoke with the old keeper, and a mug of ale, served by the fair hands of his daughter. Among those who frequented this rustic hostelry was one of those proletarian half-breed Mexicans, whose acidulate countenance was most odious to all, particularly the girl. On the other hand, her blue eyes, golden hair and sunny complexion inflamed him so as to make bold to kiss her. He is indignantly repulsed, receiving a blow on the face from the girl which sends him from the place, scowling and towering with rage. It is nightfall and the guests all having departed, the keeper leaves for a short jaunt up the road, warning the girl to be sure to lock up during his absence, which she does: then going to her room to prepare for her well-earned rest. She has just removed her waist when there is a knock at the door, and, thinking it is her father returning, she throws a mantilla over her shoulders and opens the door to the Mexican, who had seen her father depart. The cruel, black nature of the brute now asserts itself, and barring the door, he seizes the helpless girl, who screams and struggles until her father, bursting in, engages the half-breed in a fierce conflict, while the girl rushes out into the night. The Mexican having with a blow stunned the father, follows after her. Next we see the poor frail creature dashing wildly and almost aimlessly through the thick forest, coming at last, as morning breaks, to the cabin of her nearest neighbor. Staggering into the place in a state of exhaustion, she relates her experience to the miner's wife, who goes to bring her husband's aid. Hearing the Mexican's approach, the girl hides behind a curtain. In rushes the infuriated beast in search of his prey. While rummaging the place, he is attracted by the childish prattle of the miner's baby, who sits in its cradle playing with her dollie. His heart is softened by the pure, innocent chatter of the child, and he drops on his knees before the crib and prays to God to help him to resist his brutal inclinations. The girl, who Is deeply touched at this scene, comes from her hiding as he rises and is taken by the hand by her persecutor, who implores forgiveness, which is granted, and departs as she takes the baby in arms and kisses it in gratitude, for was it not her deliverer?

He arranges a dinner at his mansion and invites them all. During the day he wrote a letter to himself to be delivered to him when the entertainment was at its height. This letter, purporting to be from his attorney, tells that he has been reduced to bankruptcy by his agents' failure. Aha. Now he'll see who his friends are. He was all right while he had it, but now--now they all leave him to his apparent fate. ""So this is what they call friendship. Well, it is as false as sin. But there is true friendship to be found, and I'll find it."" So saying, he leaves behind his life of ease and enlists in the army of the low born. Securing a position as porter in a factory, he sees the other side of life: how those poor devils have to struggle for a livelihood, and yet how honest and open-hearted. None of that cringing deceit of his own set. At the factory a number of girls are employed. When the overseer insults Jennie Coleman, one of the prettiest ones, Ross knocks him down for the affront. Jennie's heart goes out at once to her protector and they are friends, for true friendship is love refined and purged of all its dross. They are often seen together. But the factory's arduous duties soon tell on Ross, and severe illness throws him flat on his back. In a poorly-furnished room he lies, without those necessities so essential to his recovery. Here faithful Jennie visits him; finding him penniless and without food or other comforts, she leaves him and rushes to a hairdressing establishment, where she sells her wealth of blonde hair, her crown of beauty of which she was pardonably proud; with the proceeds she purchases food and medicine. When Ross sees the terrible sacrifice the girl has made he deeply regrets going so far, and prays for life and strength to return materially this friendship. He is granted his wish, for they are married, and at the conclusion of the ceremony she is transported into what to her seems fairyland, clothed in gorgeous raiment and bedecked with jewels, with lackeys and servants in attendance.

The first picture shows him following a beautiful young woman down the street, and into an apartment where she goes to look at rooms. When the janitor shows the lady in the masher is close at her heels and tries in every way to attract her attention. His efforts are unsuccessful, however, as she utterly ignores him. But finally, so persistent does he become, that she, in an effort to rid herself of his presence, throws him on the floor and rushes out, locking him in the room. Soon we see him climbing out of the window and crawling along the ledge to another apartment in which a woman is seated reading. She is horrified when confronted by the stranger and is remonstrating with him for his audacity, when her husband enters, and mistaking the intruder for one of his wife's admirers, proceeds to give the innocent woman a beating, and follows the fellow downstairs, kicking him at every step. Undaunted by this harsh treatment, the young masher climbs up on a tram car, and seats himself between two women. He forces his attentions on one of the ladies, and at last becomes so obnoxious that her escort throws him down into the street and jumps down himself to have it out with him. The fellow overtakes a cab in which a young lady is riding, and to escape his enraged pursuer, he jumps in and explains the situation to the young woman, who is powerless to resist his entreaties, they soon arrive at the girl's home, and when they get out she tells her father of the stranger's conduct.

Thompson sent a message to his wife that his friend Smith was ill, and it was his duty to perform that spiritual work of mercy, ""comfort the afflicted,"" hence he would not have her wait up for him as he might be late. Smith did likewise, using Thompson as the object of his humane consideration. This done, they start off to make a night of it. First they visit the gilded throne room of a temple of Bacchus, where they moisten their parched spirits with dry Martinis. They are soon in a most glorious condition. Smith suggests the show where ""Amateur Night"" is on. Fine! They take a box. Well, what they do there simply baffled the attempt at description. Suffice it to say, it ends with their being thrown out of the place. Now they attempt to lead each other homeward. Smith's abode is reached first. Mrs. Smith is by no means easy or gullible. She hasn't swallowed the ""sick friend"" gag, and is waiting for her lord and master with a rolling pin. After much ado the pair reach the house, with difficulty ascend the stoop, and with a yank, out come the bell knob, wire, etc., followed by the irate Madam Smith, armed with that shaper of pie crust which she uses effectually on Smith's cranium. This is no place for Thompson, so he beats it. At his own house all is quiet. Poor, unsuspecting Mrs. Thompson has retired, breathing a prayer no doubt, for her dear, sympathetic, tender-hearted hubby, who she imagines is even then ministering the wants of his sick friend. Mr. Thompson is in no condition for keys or keyholes, so he adopts other means by which to gain an entrance to his home. In front of the house there is a distinct evidence of some architectural changes in the presence of piles of sand and brick, a mortar box, lumber, etc. These you may imagine are fine for Thompson in his present condition, and he falls victim to them all, finishing with a dive into the mortar box. Taking a ladder he ascends with difficulty to his bedroom window, through which he enters with as little noise as a train of cars. Mrs. T. is awakened. You can readily see what happens, but the worst is yet to come. A policeman has seen Thompson ascend the ladder and thinking him a burglar, follows. In the room the copper is set upon by the Thompsons, who throw him bodily through the window, closing a comedy film we can safely claim to be one of the most laughable ever made.",1908,movie,N/A

0000778,The Valet's Wife,"Short,Comedy",United States,us,N/A,N/A,6.0,16,"Reggie Van Twiller was the typical New York twentieth century young man, who lived his life free and untrammeled by the mesh of the matrimonial net. He resided luxuriously in bachelor apartments, surrounded by a coterie of agreeable companions. His social duties were that exigent as to prevent his working for a livelihood. Still the money must come from somewhere, so Reggie devised a scheme. His nearest kin and benefactor was an uncle, the Rev. Eben Haddock, who had often, in Reggie's extreme youth, lent a helping hand. The old gentleman was of a benevolent nature and Reggie felt sure of the successful outcome of his plan. Knowing that the old man's most ardent wish was that he, Reggie, should marry and settle down, he writes him that he had at last taken a wife, and of course Reggie's allowance was increased. This, in time, proved inadequate to his mode of living, and a second letter was dispatched that his reverence had been made a grand uncle, and another increase in the allowance was made. For two years everything went well, and Reggie was certainly tearing off the very best this old world affords. Nothing to do but spend Nunky's money. However, there came a jolt one morning, when Reggie receives a letter from his uncle stating he would arrive in New York that day for the sole purpose of seeing the wife and baby. ""Good heavens. I must have a wife, but how."" Well. Timothy Tubbs, the valet, comes to his rescue, and suggests that Mrs. Tubbs play the wife. ""Fine, hut how about the kid?"" ""We'll have her bring along a baby."" The scheme looked good, and Reggie telephones to the valet's wife to come to the apartments at once and bring a baby. Mrs. Tubbs, not unduly bright, thinks he means her own baby, a boy of fourteen. Meanwhile, the Rev. Eben Haddock has arrived and is anxious to see the family, but excuses are made, until at last Mrs. Tubbs dashes in with her boy. She is a sight, still Reggie must make the best of it: but it is out of the question to palm a fourteen-year-old boy off as a two-year-old infant, so Mrs. Tubbs is introduced as Mrs. Reggie Van Twiller and ""Buttons,"" the hallboy, is hustled to the orphan asylum to procure an infant. While uncle is shocked at the sight and manners of the pretended wife, he is annoyingly anxious to see the baby. Excuses are made that it is out with the nurse, and will be hack shortly. At last the word is given that baby is here, for ""Buttons"" has returned. Reggie at last breathes freely, but his case is of short duration, for the asylum nurse enters with the infant, and uncovering its face, one look was enough: ""Great Jupiter, it's a coon!"" Likely enough, for the order simply said ""a two-year-old infant,"" with no mention of race or color. Reggie feels that his meal ticket is irretrievably punched, so you may imagine his surprise when he sees that his uncle is not only amused at what he considers a great joke on Reggie, but greatly relieved to know that the awful freak was only a make-believe wife.",1908,movie,N/A

Alfred raises her hand to his lips in thanks for her kindness. At this moment Olaf enters. His daughter lays her hand on his arm, points to the prisoner, and pleads for him. The father shakes his head. At this juncture the high priest of Odin enters, hands a parchment to the Viking, who slowly unrolls it. He reads, ""Odin, the god of war, demands a sacrifice, and the prisoner must be offered up to-morrow at sunrise."" Again Theckla pleads with her father, who shakes his head and points to the priest.

Storm after storm of opprobrium is hurled at him until with vermiculation his restrained rage bursts forth and he takes his spite, not by ""kicking the cat,"" but by smashing everything at hand. The wife, meanwhile, has gone to the newspaper office to advertise for a Chinese servant malum in se. The Confucian arrives, is put to work, and then the fun begins. His services in the library are dispensed with by the irate husband. Next he visits the dining-room, where a globe of live goldfish excites an appetite which he proceeds to appease. He has devoured several when his piscatorial pleasure is interrupted by the housekeeper, who drags him around the room by his queue, almost pulling it from his cranium. Now, the affairs gastronomic are presided over by a lady who answers to the name of Bridget, is of pronounced Hibernian proclivities, and has a strong aversion for anything yellow. What happens when she meets the Chink throws the ""Monkey and Parrot"" story into gossamer oblivion. They get along so nicely together, baud multum.

There is a tacit understanding between Bridget and the Cop, so he makes his usual call and is being regaled with hot mince pie and coffee, when the saffron individual returns with a rat in a trap. At the right of the rat the muliebrity of Bridget asserts itself and up on a chair she leaps in terror, while the Cop fans the Chink, who drops the trap. The commotion brings the household to the kitchen in alarm. At the sight of the rat the women mount the table and chairs, while the Cop, hero of the occasion, throws the rattrap through the window, and peace again reigns.

Scarcely has the poor bereft father laid the little one in the ground, when the war cry is heard resounding in the hills. There is an uprising and the chief is summoned to action. Tearing himself from the grave of his little girl, he arms himself with his assegai and oxhide shield and is soon at the head of his band of savages, with sinister designs on the Boers. The Boers themselves have become active, and scouts have been sent out to warn those nomadic South Africans who might be on the road. One family, comprising a Boer, his wife and a four-year-old girl, is trapped, and despite extreme measures to elude the merciless black brutes, soon overtaken. Finding escape hopeless, the Boer leaps from his wagon, and sending his wife and child into the woods, seizes his rifle, in the vain hope of holding the savages at bay while the woman and child seek a place of safety. There is a shower of assegais, one of which pierces the poor fellow, dropping him into the road. Up rush the prancing, jibbing, gibbering barbarians. Finding the man dead, they rush on to find the others. The distracted woman hides the girl in a niche in the rooks, while she goes to find some avenue of escape, but she is at once apprehended and taken by the band to their camp, their chief remaining behind. The baby now comes forward to appeal to the Zulu, who is so reminded by her of his own lost treasure that his cruel nature at once softens as the little one offers her dollie as ransom for her mother.

His wife enters, tries to cheer him up, makes a proposition to which he emphatically shakes his head, then, reconsidering, takes a small picture from the wall and gives it to her. She kisses the artist good-bye, takes the picture to the office of Jacob Harris, an art dealer and money lender. Harris inspects the picture, his face lights up for a moment, then assumes a look of indifference. He shakes his head and hands the picture back. The poor woman, on the verge of tears, pleads with him and at last disposes of the picture for a five-pound note. After the woman has gone, Harris smiles to himself over the rare bargain, while the wife returns home and gives the money to her husband. Perkins is in a rage at the paltry price paid, denounces Harris in no uncertain terms and vows to get even if the opportunity is ever offered. A short time after Harris visits a rival art dealer, Moses Goldstein, where the two men are observed discussing business over their wine and cigars. Goldstein gets up and with a look of pride points to a full length portrait of himself which has just been finished. Harris admires it and determines to outdo his rival. Returning to his office he sends a note to Perkins asking him to paint a portrait of himself in character and naming the price of ten pounds. Perkins receives the letter and sees in it the chance he has longed for. He immediately accepts the offer on condition that payment for the same be made in advance. He sets about perfecting his arrangements and a little later Harris enters, and after a short talk pays over the money. The artist hands his victim the outfit of a Samoan warrior, sandals, breast-plate, helmet, sword, etc., and bids him attire himself in an adjoining room. Harris is soon ready, is perched upon a platform in an awkward pose, while the artist apparently works rapidly, so fast in fact that he opens a window to cool himself. Harris, in his scanty clothes, is almost frozen and begs the artist to close the window. He also notices at this time that his clothes are missing and begs the artist to return them. He finally offers ten pounds, but Perkins demands double, which amount is finally given to him. Harris rushes behind the screen, puts on his street clothes, comes out quickly and is shown the artist's conception of himself, a life-sized picture of a jackass. The art dealer rushes home, where we find him endeavoring in various ways to ward of pneumonia, while Perkins and his wife repair to a swell restaurant and dine sumptuously with the ""easy money.""",1909,movie,N/A

Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive. The arrival at the boarding house from the old country of Giuseppe Cassella, the violinist, filled the void in her yearning heart. Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie. All this, of course, filled Grigo with bitter hatred and he vows vengeance, which you may be sure he will work with extreme subtlety. All preparations are made for the wedding, and when the day arrives Grigo is ready for it.

The little church is decorated in honor of the affair and Grigo, with subterfuge, gets the sexton out, leaving the place to himself.

Grigo rushes hack to his room, arriving just as the wedding party is leaving for the church.

Before leaving the baby the poor mother takes one of its little shoes to keep as a memento. Returning to her cheerless home she is seized with a paroxysm and falls lifeless in a chair, with her little boy at her side. A neighbor hearing her cries runs for the parish priest, who finds the poor woman beyond human aid. Her soul has departed into eternity. She still clutches the little shoe which mutely tells the woman's sad story. The good priest takes the boy as well as his sister's shoe. Meanwhile the baby has been found by the banker and his wife and they decide to adopt it. Fifteen years elapse and we find the girl grown up in blissful ignorance of her origin, of course imagining the banker and his wife her parents, while the boy has gone through his collegiate course preparatory to Holy Orders. One afternoon while walking in the park the boy's attention is attracted by a runaway, and leaping to the roadway he seizes the bridle of a wild fractious horse and brings it to a standstill. Assisting the young lady occupant of the vehicle to a taxicab he escorts her to her home. A strong friendship between the two young people ripens later to love and the boy is seen struggling between the all-important questions as to his future, whether it be religious or secular. His love for the girl is so strong, so pure, that he determines to gain the old priest's consent to his marrying instead of entering the priesthood. What a blow it is to the good old father, but he feels it may be for the best and consents even to marry them. Now the banker's wife thinks it only just to the young people to reveal the truth about the girl, telling how she found her fifteen years before, and that one of her little shoes was missing. At this intelligence the old priest is staggered, for he sees at once that the marriage cannot take place; they are brother and sister. He raises his head in thanksgiving for the grace of God that brought about this timely revelation. However, brother and sister find ""The peace that passeth all understanding."" She becomes a nun and he goes to his ordination into the priesthood, giving their future lives up to the honor and glory of the Divine Master whose guiding hand showed the better way.",1909,movie,N/A

To hide her real feelings she is inclined to hector him a bit and delights in putting his love to the test. They are walking by the lake when Betty decides that she desires some water lilies, well knowing that there are none within reach of the shore and that no boat is at hand. Basil, nothing daunted, strides into the water and gathers a double handful. All would have been well, but, in returning to shore, Basil has the misfortune to step upon a sunken log, which turns under his tread and causes him to lose his balance. He is a sorry sight when he reaches the shore and triumphantly presents his lilies to Betty. As they turn toward the house, Cecil Gilman, a visitor to the Kenyons, is presented to her, and she accepts his escort, a little bit ashamed of the bedraggled appearance of Howard and more than willing to tease him by mildly flirting with the newcomer. Men from the city are particularly attractive to those who live apart from the whirl of town life, and Gilman makes rapid progress in his flirtation with Betty, who delights in tormenting the man she really loves.

In this Hindu pantheon there gathered natives of the Ganges Valley of all castes, with the priests, their wives, and houris; also a generous sprinkling of Western tourists, they being drawn thither by their thirst for sight-seeing. Most kaleidoscopic was the scene as out of its midst towered the stately idol Brahma. In the forehead of the idol there was embedded a mammoth diamond of fabulous value. This was termed the ""Light of the World."" Among the tourists there is one who, a stranger in a strange land, finds himself in a depleted condition as regards finances. Extravagant and improvident, he is piling up a bill at the Cawnpore Hotel without funds to meet it. The sight of this diamond at once arouses his cupidity and he determines to secure it at any hazard. A visit to the temple shows that the Brahma is attended by one veiled guard. He also learns that this guard has a sweetheart who visits him during his lonely vigil. Enlisting the services of an unscrupulous Hindu they follow the girl to her home where they force her and her father to go with them to the temple, where under threat of her father's murder she gives drugged wine to her lover, the guard. He immediately falls into a stupor, and binding the father and girl, the tourist seizes the diamond and makes his way back to the hotel. Recovering his senses, the guard gives alarm, and he and the girl are taken to prison where he is doomed to die at the end of three days for the desecration of Brahma. The girl, however, offers to remain hostage if her lover be allowed to search for the diamond. This noble offer is accepted and the girl is chained to the floor of the dungeon, while the guard, humiliated by the confiscation of his royal turban, according to the law, is set free to bring back if he can the diamond. Should he not succeed in the allotted time, three days, the girl will pay the penalty with her life. He first rushes to the Yogi, the royal seer, who shows him on the mystic mirror the face of the robber. The guard at once recognizes him as the tourist who had visited the temple, and sets out to find him, which he does at the hotel, just after the tourist has sewed the diamond up in the handle of his suit case. He contrives to engage himself as a servant and as such makes a fruitless search of the tourist's effects, He is on the point of despairing when the tourist is called upon by a diamond merchant. Effecting his presence in the room by hypnotic power, the guard manages to secure the diamond and dashing madly back to the dungeon arrives just in time to stay the uplifted scimitar from the neck of the faithful girl.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ5NTllNmItZGU1ZC00ZDMwLThlNmQtMjA1MDgwNWIxZDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@.jpg
0000816,The Broken Locket,"Short,Drama",United States,us,N/A,N/A,4.6,125,"George Peabody is a young man who has been giving free rein to his inclinations, the principal one being drink. One might have concluded he was lost, but there was the chance which the hand of Providence always bestows in the person of pretty little Ruth King, who had secretly loved George since their childhood days. She succeeds in persuading him from his reckless life, and he determines to cut off from his old loose companions by going out West and making a man of himself. Bidding Ruth and her mother good-bye, he realizes that he loves his little preserver and promises to return worthy of her love and confidence. They plight their troth with their first kiss and a heart shaped locket, which Ruth wears, she breaking it in two, giving George one side while she retains the other, which symbolized the reunion of their hearts with his return. George is fortunate to strike the West in the midst of a boom, and being an affable, bright chap, meets with success, and is soon a favorite with his employers. His life here up to this is without a blemish, but has he strength? We shall see, for as gold is tested by the fire, so a man is by temptation, and George's trial comes with the persuasion to take a drink. At first he holds out against it, but at last yields, and that drink was his undoing. Once more the craving for liquor is induced and his promise to his little sweetheart in the East is forgotten, he falls an easy victim of a Mexican girl, who pretends to love him, assuming him a rather good catch. Meanwhile, faithful little Ruth is counting the days as they drag on towards the time she imagines he will return. The Mexican girl, to secure him as her own, writes a letter to Ruth purporting to come from one of his male chums to the effect that he had been killed. The shock of this letter throws the poor girl into a delirium of fever, and for a time her life is despaired of. She recovers, however, but is hopelessly blind. What woe a man's weakness may work, but we find he is rewarded for his weakness, and some time later we see George a loathsome parasite, a dirty, ragged, drunken bum a pariah among his former associates. Back East he wanders, ignorant of the misery he has caused, and what a sight greets him. There is the ever faithful little girl, accompanied by her mother, standing at the gate, the beauties of the world forever shut out from her.

0000817,Et budskab til Napoleon paa Elba,"Short,Drama",Denmark,dk,N/A,N/A,4.1,18,"After the united powers of Europe had been successful in defeating Napoleon's vast armies, the great Emperor himself was taken prisoner and sent into exile to the Island of Elba, on the coast of Corsica. His loyal friends in France, however, would not rest, and were untiring in their efforts to liberate the Emperor from his prison. The first part of this film depicts a meeting of a few of these friends and supporters, who formulate a plan. A letter is written to Napoleon, explaining that a messenger will bring him all particulars and plans of a plot to liberate him. A young officer is elected to make the dangerous journey to Elba, to carry to Napoleon the message from his friends. But these friends did not count on the enemies which every great man has, and did not observe that one of them attended their eventful meeting. The traitor informs the police, whose assistance he obtains, and together they go in pursuit of the messenger. Tired and exhausted, the messenger finds rest for a night at a small inn on the road, but not long after his arrival there his two pursuers arrive also, and over a glass of wine discuss how they can best capture the messenger. The daughter of the innkeeper, a great admirer of Napoleon, overhears the discussion of the two men, and immediately warns the messenger, who has just sufficient time to ride away, hotly pursued by the enemies. Fortunately, he soon reaches a farm house on his way, and induces the farmer to give him other clothes. Hastily changing his dress, and with the assistance of the farmer, who shows the pursuers the wrong way, he manages to get to the frontier. He arrives safely at the coast, from which he is to take the boat to Elba. Before he lands on the coast of the island, his small craft is demolished by the waves, and he is compelled to swim through the foaming sea to his destination. But even here, on this lonely island, he is discovered by a sentry, who uses his rifle effectively, and with a bullet-wound in his shoulder the poor messenger turns back into the water, pretending to be killed. Swimming to a more secluded spot along the coast, he sees the figure of his beloved Emperor standing by the water, looking sadly in the direction of his country. Trembling with excitement, the brave messenger approaches Napoleon and delivers to him the message. Napoleon, deeply moved by the loyalty of his friends, thanks the messenger in kind words, and embraces him, to show his deep and sincere gratitude.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFlYzc0ZWMtMWY0Yi00MmM3LWFmMWUtNjcxZmY1YzMxNjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@.jpg
0000819,A Burglar's Mistake,Short,United States,us,N/A,N/A,5.1,67,"A thrilling story of an attempt at blackmail. How many of us are wont to look back and wish that we might blot out from our memory the ever recurring specter of the follies of our youth. Such was the experience of Henry J. Newman, a wealthy banker, who, in the flippant Spring of his life was guilty of a slight indiscretion which now in the sober Autumn of his existence seems so iniquitous that he fain would forget it, and above all keep it from knowledge of his family, not that it was enormous, for it was not, as Newman was a man whose standard of morals was high. However, this one false step was known of by Dick Folson, an unconscionable wretch, who, knowing Newman's sensitive nature, sees in the episode an elegant chance for graft, or rather blackmail, which he proceeds to take advantage of. He writes a letter to Newman telling him he has convincing proof of the affair and asking if it is worth to him $300 a month to keep mum. If not Mrs. Newman will be apprised of all. The letter arrives at a most opportune time to lend success to Folson's design, for Newman is surrounded by his little family, enjoying to the extreme mellifluous domesticity. He goes to his office and sends an answer to Folson saying that his demand is unreasonable and begging him to have pity. Folson writes an answer, but on second thought goes to Newman's office himself and to Newman's entreaties simply replies that it is either $300 a month, the first payment at once, or he will expose him to his wife. Newman at length yields and Folson goes away satisfied for the month at least. The money does not last long under the strain of Folson's dissipations and a week later finds him broke again. In this condition he is visited by one of his companions, who is setting out on a burglaring expedition and wants his assistance. In his present frame of mind he is ready for anything, and so readily consents, not even bothering to inquire where the job is to he pulled off. Arriving at the house they effect an entrance, and get to work gathering in the articles of value. It is not long before they are surprised by someone coming, and start to beat a hasty retreat. One of them gets out, but Folson stumbles and falls and the man of the house is on him, with revolver in hand. Folson scrambles to his feet and finds himself face to face with Newman. For a moment he feels easy, as he assumes he is safe, hut the awful reality dawns on him when Newman tells him he can now without compunction put him out of the way forever, for is he not a burglar? And is it not perfectly reasonable for him to shoot him as such? Well yon may he sure that Newman does not let slip this opportunity of assuring himself and his family peace of mind from now on, so when the police carry off the inanimate form of the intruder.",1909,movie,N/A

Pushing her way into the little mission chapel as the mass is being recited, she lays her papoose at the feet of the priest who, mistaking her gestures, baptizes it. Satisfied that the child has received the white man's medicine, she departs and her gratitude knows no bounds when the child recovers. An emigrant train, crossing the plains a dozen or more years later, camps not far from the shores of the stream from which the daughter of one of the party is seen filling a pail with water, unconscious of the stealthy approach of a canoe containing Indian braves. She is overpowered, tied hand and foot and brought to the Indian village, where a council of war decides that her fate shall be death at the stake on the morrow. And here is repaid the debt of gratitude that an Indian is said never to forget. The squaw, whose papoose was spared to her through the good offices of the white man, as she thought, and who has grown to be a fine lad, takes a handkerchief from the captive, and placing it in the lad's moccasin, bids him carry it to the captive's friends.

Reaching the opposite shore, he falls exhausted, rises and falls again, and again drags himself to his feet and continues his weary journey, finally reaching the emigrants' camp, where, after delivering his message, he swoons. The campers and cowboys mount in haste, and by hard riding reach the Indian village before the captive is put to the stake.

Little Edith sinks rapidly, so the maid is again sent. This time he is about to leave, as the child is out of danger and will recover. So he leaves the poor family, happy and relieved, to rush madly to his own home. What a contrast! There across the lifeless form of his dear child lies his moaning, horror-stricken wife.

He calls to apprise the old man that his notes are overdue, and insists upon a settlement, which the poor old fellow is unable to do. While there he meets Mercedes, the old man's beautiful daughter, and falls deeply in love with her, and offers to cancel the obligations for the daughter's hand in marriage. Now Mercedes is enamored of Carlos, a poor peon of the village, whom she loves in return and when the suggestion of the ranchero is broached she indignantly repulses it. However, upon realizing her poor father's condition she decides to make the sacrifice and consents. She then bids Carlos call to see her to break the unpleasant intelligence to him and part company. The lover calls and is almost heartbroken when Mercedes tells him the sad news. While they are engaged in the act of separating, the ranchero enters the adjoining room and through the half open door hears the sorrowful word of the last farewell between the young couple. He is so touched by the pure, self-sacrificing love of the lovers, that he softens and feels he is worthy of bitter reproach for being the instrument of tearing asunder two trusting hearts such as these, so he makes up his mind that such shall not be. He then enters the room, and bidding the young ones to be of good heart, he not only joins their hands in bonds of true love, but makes them a present of the promissory notes which he had threateningly held over her father's head but a few moments before.

First of all, Aunty and the reverend gentleman object strenuously to the candied affection indulged in by the young couple. Then they proceed to run things to their own Ideas. The cook does not furnish the table to suit them, so there is trouble in the kitchen; the servants are not alert enough, so they fall in for a share of the interlopers' despotism: and soon the household is in a tumult verging upon insurrection.

This Biograph adaptation makes Master Marner a cobbler instead of a linen weaver, but this change does not weaken, nor make less romantic, the story. Silas is first seen in the act of ministering to his dying friend, and while engaged in this act of mercy. William Dane enters stealthily and steals the dying man's money, leaving Marner's handkerchief alongside the dresser so as to throw the blame on him. The money is discovered missing, and. of course, circumstantial evidence points conclusively to Marner, who protests innocence, and is given a chance of vindicating himself through that old superstitious practice of visiting the church and in presence of the elders in the vestry kneels and prays and draws lots. Fate is against him, and he draws the black card which declares him guilty. This is final, and his friends shun him as they would a leper. He makes good the stolen money out of his own hard-earned savings, and leaves his native village for another section of the country. Here he pursues his vocation of shoemaking. His trouble has made him a misanthrope and miser, niggardly hoarding the gains of his toil, guarding it with a jealousy induced by despicable money lust. A confirmed recluse, he spurns the advances of all: beggars are driven away empty-handed, with vituperation; in fact, the strain of charity hitherto dominant in his nature is effaced. His one thought is his golden coins; his only pleasure is the musical clink as they fall from his hands in counting them, afterwards biding them in the wall by removing a stone and placing them behind it. One day this is observed by a couple of thieves who peer through his window. Awaiting an opportunity, they enter during his absence and seize the money, making off with it. When Silas re-enters he sets about indulging in his only diversion, but what a revelation! The money is gone. Like a maniac he dashes out in search of the thieves, but without success, returning and dropping on his workbench in utter despair. Meanwhile, a poor, deserted mother of the parish, with her little child, wanders from her home in quest of her perfidious husband, only to die on the road. The child, alone, continues on the way, and entering Marner's hovel, sinks exhausted on the hearthstone. Silas arouses from his lethargy and is amazed to find the little baby, which toddles to his arms. What a change comes over him! Folding the little one to his breast, he exclaims, ""This shall be my recompense."" Indeed a fair exchange. That moment his flinty heart softens and he becomes benevolence personified.",1909,movie,N/A

The Biograph here holds up to your pity a court-fool, whose inordinate love for his child prompted him to plan vengeance which reverted upon himself. The Duke suffers from melancholia and his courtiers are at wits' end to dissipate his ennui. Diversion of all sorts are brought, but without success, until at last they decide to abduct the pretty daughter of the fool and bring her to the Duke. This is effected, and when the Duke sees her he falls deeply in love with her, but her pure innocence instills in him a higher, holier devotion than he was accustomed to experience, so he harkens to her plea, and throwing his cloak about her, sees her safely home. This is witnessed by the fool, who is in hiding, and misjudging the Duke's attitude, vows vengeance. To this end he enlists the services of a nomad couple who are dwelling in a hut not far off. He bargains with them that to kill the man he shall point out he will pay them five hundred louis. The pact is made, and the Duke is pointed out to them by the fool as he strolls in the gardens with the girl. As the Duke leaves the girl she espies the trio skulking on the grounds and follows them to the hut, where she overhears the plan. She at once decides to save the Duke, but how? To tell him would incriminate her old father. Nothing seems feasible but self-sacrifice, which she bravely determines to do. Going to her house, she dons male attire and with the cloak the Duke had loaned her thrown over her shoulders she bids adieu to her home and life and like a soldier goes bravely unto death. Entering the hut, her face hidden, she receives the blow intended for another and dies before the horror-stricken gypsy couple, who discover their mistake. They, however, put her body in a sack, and when the fool appears, collect their promised fee and flee. The fool is now in a state of fiendish exultation over the seeming success of his vengeance, and after dancing gleefully around the sack, determines to make away with it, but upon picking it up is startled by the litheness of the form enclosed. Ripping open the sack, the sight that greets him fairly freezes his blood, for there lies his own daughter, cold in death, a victim of his own dastardly plot.

In the meantime discovery of the theft is made, and a photograph of Kitty, bearing the legend, ""To my friend Steve,"" is found close to the spot where the cattle were rounded up. A visit to Steve Howard's adobe follows, but Howard's entire ignorance of the entire affair seems to point out his innocence. There can be but one other Steve who could be guilty, and Bronson is hunted up. He is apprised at his sweetheart's home, accused of the theft, and is about to be led away to the lynching tree, when Howard, who has come upon the scene, steps in front of Bronson and shoulders the guilt himself. Bronson is thunderstruck but does not offer to interfere when Howard is led away. He is not quite capable in his black soul of appreciating the nobleness of Howard's sacrifice. On the other hand Howard is firmly convinced that Bronson is innocent and it is to make happy the girl he loves in taking Bronson's place. Bronson, after the party has left, turns to the girl and begs her to go East with him. She consents and goes into the house to pack her suitcase.

At the beginning of the Civil War, Kentucky attempted to hold a neutral position between the belligerents, and her sons decided for themselves which side's cause to take up; hence it was that many a Kentucky home was divided. The sentiment of the people seemed evenly balanced, and when old Mr. Wilkinson entered with the newspaper heralding the proclamation, ""War Is Declared,"" George, his youngest son, took up the Union flag, declaring his intention to fight under its stripes, calling to his brother Robert to do likewise. But Bob's heart is with the Confederates, and he declines to listen to his brother's reasoning and so goes to enlist in the Southern army. The old Kentucky home is divided; it is brother against brother. Later, Robert is selected as the bearer of sealed orders, and as he will probably have to pass the Union lines, he is attired in Union uniform. Starting on his perilous journey, he is soon dangerously near the Union outposts, where George is seen posting sentries. Robert is discovered while climbing up the side of the mountain, and fired on by George, who is ignorant of his identity. Fleeing for safety, he is followed and apprehended by the Union forces, when, for the first time, Robert and George meet. But the soldier knows no kindred, and George secures Rob's papers and places him under guard to be shot. While fording a stream, Robert by strategy manages to bolt, and outdistancing his pursuers, rushes into his old home for shelter. Here he is treated by his father as a fugitive and would have been turned out, but a mother's love knows not the laws of war and shields him. Rushing him upstairs to her room, she bids him get into her bed, while she lies alongside, armed with a pistol. George enters, and searching the house, comes to his mother's room. He at once discerns where Robert is, and would have dragged him from his hiding, but his mother, with the pistol at her head, threatens to fire if he advances one step. In the face of this, George falters in his duty and leaves. Robert later escapes. Finally, the war over, George returns home 'neath triumphant banners, promoted in rank, and with the whole village assembled to greet him. The old home is the scene of great rejoicing. But what a contrast is seen on the outside. There we see Robert, ragged and homeless for the ""Lost Cause,"" staggering up to the house. Reaching the portals, he gets a glimpse of the festive scene on the inside, and sorrowfully starts away, but old Uncle Jasper sees him and drags him in. Here is shown the most impressive scene ever depicted in moving pictures. The mother folds her lost boy to her heart, and George, with the Union flag thrown over his arm, stretches forth his hand to his brother, who, with the old, tattered colors of the Confederacy held affectionately to his breast, receives the warm grasp, typifying the motto of Kentucky, ""United we stand, divided we fall.""",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4ZDBhM2QtMTQyMS00NTM5LThhNGQtM2UzNmRlNDhjZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQwMzk4OTY@.jpg

Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen. He on the other hand, not knowing of course her true self, falls in love with her. All this is most agreeable to the women folks, who at once conspire to rid the place of her, which one brings about by having her accused of the theft of the musician's violin. He, of course, believes her innocent, but she is discharged nevertheless. Lady Helen is so moved by the poor fellow's kindness, that she interests herself in his behalf and secures for him a position as a director at the Conservatory, for which he calls to thank her and finding her a lady of quality would shrink humbly from her presence, but she will not let him for she too loves him.

Our story starts with the Colonel and his two nieces starting out to make a short cut to Fort George, accompanied by a scout and piloted by a trusted Indian guide, who was none other than Big Serpent. This traitorous redskin is elated at the opportunity to perpetrate a long cherished revenge. To this effect he has notified his followers and they stand in readiness to act at his call. Proceeding on their journey, they come to a mountain stream, where the party rest and take water, Big Serpent and the scout leading the horses into the shade of the wood. Just prior to the party's arrival, Leather Stocking and Uncas meet, and when they learn Big Serpent is guiding the party, they express their misgivings, being sure of his sinister intention, and truly, for while they are indicating their fears, the scout rushes on and tells that he had been assaulted and the horses killed. Leather Stocking and Uncas volunteer to see the party through their danger, if possible, but they have not proceeded far when the woods seem alive with Indians and the party is almost surrounded. Taking the only avenue of retreat, they manage to reach the stockade just ahead of the bloodthirsty Indians. Here a spirited battle ensues, which is not destined to last long, as ammunition is low. It is hoping against hope, for we now find there are but two charges left, and after that they will be at the mercy of the foe. Leather Stocking, however, feels that there is but one chance, hazardous though it be, of getting to the fort for aid. His plan is subtle in the extreme. Donning an animal's skin, he plunges into the swirly, tortuous river at the back of the stockade, knowing that the crafty Indians would waste no ammunition on game, but save it for the enemy, ammunition being a scarce and precious commodity. In this manner he succeeds in reaching the soldiers' quarters, where he falls, exhausted, after telling them of the danger of the party. The soldiers start off at once, and are none too soon, for in the meantime the Indians have effected an entrance into the stockade with battering rams and have the party tied up to trees, piling brush to incinerate them. The torch is already applied to the brush about Uncas, and only the timely arrival of the soldiers and annihilation of the redskins saves his life. Uncas then accompanies the party on their way to the brow of the bill, where we leave him standing alone, the last of the Mohicans.",1909,movie,N/A

He played violin for the dancing at many of the East Side balls. Grace, Vivian and Daisy are sisters in a family of the workaday class. Vivian and Daisy are pretty young girls, while Grace is considered homely on account of an ugly scar on her cheek, the result of an accident at her work. The two pretty sisters are great favorites, enjoying social distinction, while drudgery and loneliness is the lot of poor Grace. We see the contrast on Saturday. Vivian and Daisy are getting ready to go to a party, and Grace is allowed to mope at home. Mother, however, urges Grace to go, and helps her to dress in a becoming frock. At the ball Vivian and Daisy are the center of attraction, engaging all the gallants' attention, but Grace remains the wallflower. The ball is over, and the poor girl would be allowed to leave without an escort, but Carl, the blind musician, gropes his way through the hall, and the girl, appreciating his social proscription from the experience of her own sad lot, offers him her hand to lead the way. In that grasp of the hands there is a communion of two pure souls and tender hearts. It is the enkindling of love between them, and they become sweethearts. Shortly afterwards their betrothal is announced, when a young doctor, upon examination, declares that Carl's sight can be restored, but it would require money to have it done, as the services of a specialist would be necessary. Now the poor fellow is more miserable than before, feeling that his cure is possible, yet he is without the necessary funds, as his engagements have only afforded him a bare living, and frugal as he might be he could not hope to accumulate sufficient to pay the doctor. Grace, however, has saved something and is at first elated with the idea to help him, but on viewing herself in the mirror she reasons that when the light comes he will see her as she is and she will then lose his love. Her hesitation is but for a moment, for the true heart is unselfish, and she at least can make him happy. The eminent doctor is employed, and his work is successful. But what a pathetic scene is the removing of the last bandage. He is in the seventh heaven of delight and calls for her. She at first is loath to show herself, fearing the consequences, but he does not consider her personal appearance, which is at best transitory, and which he now sees for the first time, but her heart, the purity of which he has known by intuition.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZiNjA5NzEtZDk5My00OWRhLTljODAtNGU1Y2QyZDQyOThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@.jpg

Jack Howard who, with his chum Ralph, occupies a pretty studio in the Artists' Quarters, has just been married and some vague rumor of the event has reached the ears of his Uncle Peter. Now, Uncle Peter is a man of millions and Jack is his heir; and, like many other men of affairs, Uncle Peter considers it among his prerogatives to decide the domestic future of his lawful heir. He, therefore, sends Jack a peremptory telegram forbidding him to marry, under penalty of disinheritance. As Jack has already committed that indiscretion it is too late to obey the command so, when Uncle Peter announces that he is coming for himself to see about things, the situation becomes desperate; but Jack is a young man of resource and, despite the fact that Ralph has a wife and baby, he insists upon introducing his bride to Uncle Peter as the lawful spouse of Ralph. Jack's mother-in-law has a constitutional objection to models in her son-in-law's studio, so when she discovers one posing there, Jack sees no way out of the dilemma except to introduce the model as Ralph's wife, thus presenting Ralph with his third spouse. Things might have gone very smoothly under such circumstances, but for the fact that, to Uncle Peter. Ralph must appear to have one wife, and to Jack's mother-in-law, another; and must keep the situation from his own lawful wife. How thoroughly things get mixed when the different members of the families arrive together at the studio can better be told by the film than by words.

Mrs. Ross, whose mother is very ill, has in attendance a trained nurse, who has received an urgent message to come to her own home, owing to the illness of her sister. As Mrs. Ross is dressed and ready to attend an afternoon tea at Mrs. Parker's, this forced absence of the nurse is very inopportune. However, little Alice. Mrs. Ross's seven-year-old daughter, is a bright child, so she feels that she can trust her to look after her grandma, and give her the medicine at the regular intervals. Mrs. Ross, herself, is suffering from a painful abrasion on her hand, for which she has procured an antiseptic to bathe it with, which is a deadly poison. It happens that the antiseptic and grandma's medicine are contained in similar-shaped bottles, and Mrs. Ross in her hurry and excitement takes away the wrong bottle. While at Mrs. Parker's, the hostess cuts her finger with a paper knife and Mrs. Ross offers her the antiseptic to bathe it. When she discovers she has carried away the medicine, leaving the poison for the child to give grandma. Looking at the clock, she finds it is on the hour of the administering of the dose. The poor woman is beside herself in fearful helplessness, when Mrs. Parker suggests the telephone. This she tries, and she is put in further trepidation at her inability to get connection, for at Central the operators are too busy chatting to take notice. She at length gets her home and is relieved to learn from the child that grandma has not been given the poison, owing to the fact that baby had spilt the first spoonful she poured out.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk3MGRiZmYtNGQwZC00NmQ2LThlZDQtNDlmZTViNjViZjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@.jpg

Little Bear's worldly possessions are slim, and Great Elk Horn rejects his meager offerings in favor of Standing Rock's rich gifts, and so Rising Moon is taken away by him to his wigwam, where she is left while her husband that is to be goes hunting. Taking advantage of his absence she steals away to the forlorn heart of her own choice, Little Bear, before it is too late. Standing Rock returning and finding her gone at once surmises the truth, and gathering his companions together, starts in pursuit. Little Bear and Rising Moon hearing their approach endeavor to make their escape. Pushing their way towards the river bank, with Standing Rock and his braves following, they leap into a canoe and are soon dashing along in the swift current of the mountain stream, which is in places the most dangerous of rapids. The feat seems ominous, but is safely accomplished, and was worthy of a better fate than capture, which they were later. Death of both is the reward, and they are bound together to this end. The ire of Standing Rock demanded more than mere death, so he proceeds to taunt and torture his rival. This is received with such stoicism by Little Bear, that Standing Rock is amazed to the point of admiration for the brave's fortitude, and not only cuts the cords that bind him, but bestows upon him the Eagle Feather, the highest honored gift to the brave, and bids he and Rising Moon to go and may they be happy.

Effie wisely chose Dave, and we see the happy couple returning from their wedding and starting in on a happy, simple life. Dave and Effie romp about the fields, among the cows and sheep, like a couple of wild children. Dave is comfortably situated and is able to provide his wife a pleasant though modest home. For five years they are happy indeed, a little child coming in the meantime to shed an extra ray of sunshine, but, alas! The tempter appears in the person of Woodson, who returns, and with honeyed, flattering tongue poisons the mind of Effie and makes the grind of simple life decidedly irksome. Repeated entreaties on his part make the poor woman drift into the wrong path so far as to listen to his persuasion. At length she almost decides to go away with him, but later she struggles against the inclination until a note telling her he will be at the old bridge to take her with him decides her. Leaving a note of farewell for her husband on the table, she goes to the place of meeting. She has hardly left when baby, finding the letter and innocently taking it up, follows on, guided as if by the hand of Providence. Baby arrives on the scene and hands the letter to mamma just as Woodson drives up in an auto. What a powerful lesson this is to the poor woman. Who can resist the hand of the baby? For ever since the beginning we have harkened to the injunction. ""And a little child shall lead them."" It is needless to add that the woman sees clearly the error of her way and recoils before it is too late, leaving Woodson standing in the road, perturbed and chagrined.

Desperate beyond expression, he realizes that if something don't turn up he will be turned out of his boarding house by the mercenary landlady, whose daughter Nellie he is in love with, which love is returned. Hulda, the Swedish maid, is deeply smitten with the young writer, and is grieved at his misfortune. An idea seizes her.

M. Marius, M. Gillenormand's grandson, sees Jean Valjean's foster-daughter Cosette, now grown into a beautiful young woman, in Luxembourg and falls madly in love with her. Valjean, apprised of the love affair, refuses to give his consent, and Marius induces Cosette to marry him without parental sanction. Meanwhile, Thenardier, once the keeper of the Inn of the Soldier of Waterloo at Montfermeil but now reduced to dire straits in Paris, recognizes in a benevolent old man the visitor to the inn who removed the child Cosette and who must be the escaped convict, Jean Valjean. Playing upon his sympathy, Thenardier induces Jean to visit his apartment, and Marius, who occupies the next room because a quarrel with his grandfather has reduced him to want, overhears a part of the plot and rescues Jean by warning the police. Jean makes his escape and next encounters Marius at the barricade, where he releases Javert, the human bloodhound, who, through a score of years, has remorselessly hunted Jean. Gavriche, the gamin, is there, enjoying the battle until his brave sortie to rifle the cartouche boxes of the dead soldiers brings to an end his gay life and finds for him a place beside his dead sister Eponine, whose love for Marius led her to assume a boy's dress and follow him to the barricade. Jean learns of Marius's relations with Cosette and when the regulars carry the barricade he makes his escape into the sewer with the unconscious man upon his back. In the sewer he encounters Thenardier, who permits him to escape from the locked gate by means of a false key, at the same time cutting from Marius's trousers a portion of one leg as a means of identification. Later Thenardier's attempt to blackmail Marius clears away the cloud of suspicion that has hovered over Jean in Marius's mind, and he and Cosette hurry to Jean, whom they find dying of starvation and heartbreak, but happy at the sight of Cosette once more. The story has been slightly altered to give greater dramatic value to the scenes and clarity to the narrative, and the result is a release in keeping with the earlier sections of the same story, though, like the others, this story is in itself an interesting tale apart from the earlier releases.",1909,movie,N/A
0000970,Molière,"Short,Biography,Drama",France,fr,N/A,N/A,5.8,78,"We first see Moliere at work in his father's shop, when a boy. All the employees are busy at their appointed tasks, except the youthful playwright, who snatches time to re-read one of his earliest efforts. The door opens and the Italian comedian, Scaramouche, enters in quest of a particular style of chair. Moliere tenders his play for perusal; but, just as Scaramouche begins to be interested, Poquelin, the father of Moliere, comes in unexpectedly and the play is hastily thrown out of sight. Again the boy poet places it in the comedian's hand, and some clever work is done by Scaramouche, as he tries to read the manuscript without being detected by the stern upholsterer. The next scene shows Moliere at the Louvre palace, where he meets Louis XIV for the first time. Here we see the scorn of the courtiers for the actor-dramatist and the consideration shown for him by the King. This scene will be remembered for the delicate beauty of the interiors shown. Next we view the stately splendor of the festival at Versailles, where hundreds of courtiers, ladies in waiting and great nobles attend on Louis XIV. The beauty of the court costumes, which set the fashion for all the royal houses in Europe at that time, and the courtly air and demeanor of every individual in the royal pageant, have been faithfully reproduced. One cannot but marvel at the excellence of the training of this vast throng, every one of whom acts his or her part as if manor-born. We must take off our hats to this Gaumont producer. As Moliere comes into the scene, the acting of the King, the courtiers and of the great actor himself, is faultless. When the King places his arm around Moliere's shoulders and walks off with him, it is a delight to watch the faces of the surprised and jealous train of followers. And when next we see Louis seated at table with Moliere, serving him with his own hands, the cup of the courtiers is full. The scene showing the distraction of Moliere over the desertion of his wife is a pathetic picture and displays talented emotional acting. Then, when she appears before finally leaving him, and we watch the play of coquetry on her witching face and note her charm of manner and grace of deportment, we do not wonder at poor Moliere's abandonment to despair. The attempt of the faithful maid servant to arouse Moliere from his apathy and melancholia is a brilliant specimen of silent acting in both roles. The last appearance of Moliere, and his first in the role of Malade, is a fine depiction of the stage of the tennis court theater and of the French manner of acting a part in the seventeenth century. Then follow his sudden illness and death.",1910,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExZjBhYzItOWQ5OS00NGUwLTljMTktMDFjNWUzNWFkODA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@.jpg

John was a bighearted, indulgent husband whose every thought was for his wife's happiness, and while Louise was a devoted wife, still there was the strain of selfishness ever apparent, for she who studies her glass neglects her heart. She yearned for ostentation, and poor John was in no position to appease this desire. However, an occasion presents itself when they can at least bask in the radiance of the social limelight, in an invitation to attend a reception tendered a foreign prince. John is in the height of elation, hut Louise meets him with that time-honored remark, ""I've nothing to wear."" Well, he feels the strength of her argument, so goes and pawns his watch and chain to procure her a gown fitting for the occasion. The gown emphasizes the absence of jewel ornamentation, so they visit their friend and neighbor, who lends them a handsome necklace. At the reception she makes quite a stir and is presented to the prince, who becomes decidedly attentive. Arriving home after the affair, Louise rehearses the incidents of the event, when suddenly she stands petrified with horror. ""My God! The necklace is gone."" High and low they search, and even back to the ballroom, but without result, for we have seen it stolen from her neck by a sneak thief while she is talking with the prince. Unable to find the necklace, they swear to give their fingers to the bone, their life's blood until it is paid for. But then there is the humiliation of not returning the jewels, so they hunt for a duplicate. At the jeweler's they find one, in appearance an exact copy, but the price is $20,000. Twenty thousand dollars to ones in their condition meant a large fortune. However, John borrows money on his salary, gets loans from his various friends and is granted a large advance by his employer, giving notes for same: in fact, mortgaging his very life as the result of vanity. With the money he purchases the duplicate and gives it to their friend, who is unaware of the substitution. Meanwhile, the thief has taken the necklace to a pawnshop and finds it is a worthless imitation, and so throws it into the rubbish heap. Five years later we find the couple toiling, toiling, but still in bondage; after night in the endeavor to make a little extra above his ordinary salary. Ten years we find them, still hounded by the note collectors, aged and broken in health, yet determined. Twenty years, and the last penny on the necklace is paid, but at the expense of their bodily strength. Having cleared up his debt with his employer, he is discharged, being too feeble to do the work.

Then, ""two years later,"" we witness the arrival of General Custer at Post Fort Lincoln. An order superseding him in command of the expedition is received. Then follows a scene where the officers beg him not to trust ""Reno"" with an important command, as it was known in the army that bad blood existed between these two officers. A bit of unwritten history is here introduced. The Commander of the Post, Col. Godfrey, had a pretty daughter, Dollie, who was in love with Lieut. Glenn, one of Custer's subalterns, and she, not relishing being separated from her sweetheart, inadvertently learned that there was to be an officer sent back to bring forward a supply train as soon as the General located the Indians. She makes a written request asking the General to send back Lieut. Glenn. The love interest bearing upon the lives of these two young people is, we hope, not intrusively blended into and made a part of the, present historical subject. We then see General Custer and his officers watching the hostiles through their field glasses. Custer decides to attack. Reno is given command of the supporting column, in spite of the protests of the assembled officers. The General thinks of little Dollie Godfrey's letter, reads it, grants the request it contains by ordering young Lieut. Glenn back to the fort. Next we see the wily ""Rain in the Face"" and his band of naked, painted devils leading Custer's cavalry into a trap; riding up just out of gunshot, they tantalize Custer into making a charge. The ""Gallant Command"" answer the order with a yell and are off after the fleeing band of savages. A sudden dip in the prairie and the Indians disappear, then up a rise of ground perhaps thirty feet in height; then come the soldiers, every man urging his horse to his utmost in order to gain on the yelling red fiends in front. Over the bluff they go, and the sight that meets their gaze freezes the blood, for stretched away as far as the eye can reach, upright and naked on their ponies they sit, three thousand Sioux warriors, waiting for the handful of white soldiers to be brought to the slaughter. Too late, Custer sees his error; nothing daunted, he gives the order, column half left, about face, retreat, steady, men, ride for your lives to higher ground; then two miles away Reno's officers hear the volley that greets Custer from that bronze line, and beg him, Reno, to go to Custer's assistance. Then we see ""The Last Stand""; horses sent to the rear to be later stampeded, thus leaving no escape for the brave little band, now reduced to forty-one men; the red circle of death closes in about them and ""Rain in the Face"" is avenged. Two days later the news reaches Fort Lincoln. On the same day a young officer, dust covered, his uniform in shreds, rides into the Fort and delivers Custer's last message, sent a few hours before the massacre. Glenn had fallen into the hands of a roving band of Sioux, but makes his escape and reaches the Fort, to learn for the first time the fate of his comrades on the Little Big Horn.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NjMjU4ZjQtMTJhYi00Njg4LTg5ZmMtMDllM2RjODdiOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@.jpg

Both father's and mother's whole life is centered in their little one, and the little family are as happy as can be until death tears the baby from them. As the child's soul leaves its body, so the poor heart-broken mother's reason leaves her. What an awful blow to Murray. The loss of his child was indeed hard to bear, but his dear wife hurled into a living death was worse. A trained nurse must be her constant companion, and the poor woman spent her time fondling the dolls and playthings of her lost one. Murray's beat lay in the tenderloin section of the city, and many curious characters came under his notice. In the cellar under a junk shop there lived, or rather existed, a Sicilian couple of the very lowest type, who eked an existence by begging and theft. A little orphan girl fell into their keeping and they forced her to beg on the street for them, beating her into submission if she refused, which the child's proud spirit inclined her to do. Out in the snow storm, thinly clad, the poor child was made to stand at the stage doors of the theaters or in front of saloons to work upon the sympathy of the generous-hearted habitués. She was always accompanied by the Sicilian woman, who took good care that she didn't escape. Murray, on his rounds, runs into them and his suspicions are aroused, so he follows them and enters their hovel just in time to see the poor creature receiving a frightful beating. With a terrific blow he sends the man reeling to the floor and hurling the woman on top of him he seizes the child in his arms. At this moment a couple of his squad, in answer to his whistle, enter and take the Sicilians in charge. An idea dawns on him. He takes the little one home and presents her to his poor demented wife. The presence of the child at once restores her reason, so the clouds of sorrow are dissipated and happiness reigns. The picture presents a moral showing the singular working of God's justice in taking to Himself an unsullied soul that another might be saved.",1909,movie,N/A

This is a creation of headgear that for size outstrips anything yet designed by the disordered mind of the modiste. As a ""skypiece"" it is a ""skyscraper,"" and in decoration it looks like a combination horticultural and food exhibition. Nevertheless, this mammoth ""lid"" was seized onto by the feminine world with the avidity of a boy for his first baseball suit. It is only natural that our friend, Mrs. Jones, should experience this obsession, and what woe it preambled! The Jones family are seated at breakfast. Mr. Jones is reading the morning paper. An account of a kidnapping by gypsies engages his attention, and he is filled with horror at the anticipation of the possible abduction of his young hopeful, a baby one year old. He tries to impress Mrs. J., but she is fascinated by the millinery ""ads."" The situation for Jones becomes more tense when on going outside he sees a couple of the odious gypsies with a child. Mrs. Jones takes herself off to buy a peachbasket, leaving baby in charge of the nurse, who, being of a romantic nature, enlists the services of the gypsies to tell her fortune. Mrs. Jones returns and almost catches the nursemaid, who is quite beside herself at her near discovery. Mrs. Jones places the huge box containing the hat on the table, while the nurse, placing the baby on the floor, assists in extricating the hat from its crate. Putting on the hat, Mrs. J. goes into the next room, followed by the maid, to view the effect in the mirror. .Mr. Jones now arrives, and his first thought is for baby; he cares naught for the peachbasket hat. Baby is nowhere to be seen. The nurse, in her excitement, does not remember where she placed it. Through the house they rush fruitlessly; out on the road and on after the disappearing gypsies, who are overtaken only to find that the baby the woman carries is not a Jones. The clouds of despair o'ershadow the couple in their dining-room, when suddenly the hat box on the floor is seen to move. There, under the hollow cube of pasteboard, is found baby Jones, the box having been blown by a gust of wind off the table over the child.",1909,movie,N/A

Luca sleeps and his wife, Ottima, is persuading her lover, Sibald, to dispatch him. With upraised dagger, he approaches the couch, and the dagger is about to fall, when Pippa's song is heard. What a transformation. Conscience turns their eyes into their very souls and how black the aspect, ""God's in His heaven. All's right with the world!"" Are we not of the world? How stand we in the sight of God? What ministering angel art thou, who with song has stayed the hand that would have done irreparable wrong?""

One day Tom wandered near the palace gates. Too near, thought the guard on duty, for he cuffed him away, and Tom cried aloud under the sting of his blows. Edward the prince, was in the palace grounds near the gate, and, hearing the outcries, made inquiry as to the cause. A courtier brought the answer. Edward had a gentle heart. There was misery in the cries of the lad outside. He ordered him brought within to console him. The prince's word was law. The pauper boy was brought before him. Never having conversed with a boy of the streets before, Edward retired with him to a secluded room and there both noticed the resemblance between them through an accidental joint glance in a mirror. The prince suggested the boyish prank that they change clothes tor the moment. No sooner said than done. Tom pranced about in the prince's royal raiment and truly royal he looked, while the prince masqueraded as the pauper boy and looked Tom Canty to the life. At this moment Tom spoke of the unnecessary brutality of the guard. In a flash, forgetting his attire, the prince was off to chastise the guard. Alone and with one whom he thought the pauper boy, the guard was not gentle. He pitched the prince in beggar's rags into the street. Wildly the prince proclaimed himself, but a jeering crowd drove him away. Before he could return he encountered the elder Canty and was hauled off, despite his protests, to their hovel. Here he was beaten because he had begged no money, and later was dragged off to join a band of roving rogues. From these he was rescued by a poor knight, Miles Herndon, and the two became fast friends, though the knight laughed at the supposed beggar's pretensions to royalty. Meanwhile Tom had been having many strange adventures at the palace, where he was supposed to be the prince. His singular conduct caused an impression among the couriers that he was demented. King Henry VIII, Edward's father, died at this juncture, and here truly was a fateful circumstance; for the pauper hoy was hailed king of England, and, though in agony of mind over it, was about to be crowned. The ceremony was in actual occurrence in Westminster Abbey when the prince succeeded in gaining admittance. Loudly he proclaimed himself and would have been struck down by the soldiery as a traitor had it not been for Tom himself. He was the first to acknowledge his rightful king, and it was through his aid that Edward was enabled to step to the throne and receive the crown that in a few moments more would have been placed on the pauper boy's head.",1909,movie,N/A

Milton left El Paso in the auto for an extensive tour and was to meet her at Jonesville two weeks later. She has arrived somewhat ahead of the time set. Jim tells her to wait, then borrowing a horse, rides at breakneck speed back to the ranch. He traces the auto to the Mexican's shanty, arriving just in time to prevent the wedding. Without any explanation Watson forces Milton and Annie into the auto and orders the chauffeur to drive back to Jonesville. When they arrive at the station Milton is forced to confess to Annie and the rightful Mrs. Milton his nefarious scheme. Jim leaves the trio and saunters over to the post office and general store. A short time later, repentant and ashamed, Annie comes to him and begs forgiveness. Jim's big heart melts and he takes her in his arms and restores the ring to her finger.",1909,movie,N/A

0001014,The Renunciation,"Short,Western",United States,us,N/A,N/A,5.0,113,"The appearance of pretty little Kittie Ryan played havoc at Yellow Hill Mining Camp. Joe Fielding and Sam Walters were boyhood chums, and becoming obsessed with the gold fever came out to Yellow Hill as partners. Both sturdy, honorable chaps, they found congeniality in each other's company. They worked together, shared the fruits of their toil, and, in fact, seemed a monumental typification of true friendship. We see them sitting on the rocks smoking and talking over old times, no doubt repeating the lines of Byron: ""Ah! happy years! once more, who would not be a boy."" But, lo! A cloud. The heart-high disturber appears in the person of Kittie, the pretty niece of old Steve Ryan, on a visit from the East. Joe and Sam are immediately smitten with the little one, whose lustrous orbs pierce their very soul. Both make up their minds to win her, as does every other fellow in the camp. However, Joe seems to hold high cards, and so the erstwhile chums are now bitter rivals. They quarrel over the precious bit of femininity, and a challenge to a duel with pistols is the outcome. Joe is a dead shot, while Sam's aim is uncertain. Upon returning to his cabin, Joe's eye alights on a photograph of the boyhood chums, and his heart softens. He realizes the duel can only result in the death of his chum, so he decides it shall not take place, and he writes a note, renouncing claim to the girl's attentions, and will leave the place at sunrise; in conclusion, hoping that Sam and Kittie will be happy. Relieved and happy at his self-sacrifice, he lies on his cot and sleeps. Meanwhile Sam is in his cabin in a state of nervous perturbation, knowing well that it would be fatal to face Joe's unerring gun, hence he plans assassination with a knife. Kittie learns his intention and follows him to Joe's cabin. Here a fierce conflict with bowie knives ensues, Joe having been taunted by Sam into participation. At a most crucial moment, Kittie rushes in and parts them, thereby intercepting a calamity. When she finds she is the cause of their conflict, she pretends amazement, and introduces to their notice as her favored Strephon the most effeminate, namby-pamby dude one has ever gazed upon. The contrast between the big, rugged miners and the weak apology for a human being is indeed superlative. One look is enough, and the chums in unison exclaim: ""Well, I'll be."" but there were ladies present.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUxYzYxYWQtMTdmMS00ZjNlLWJlNjUtMzk2YTE5YmE1NGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@.jpg

The subject opens with the return home of Prince Dimitri, who meets the maid Katusha, a little peasant girl, and is instantly charmed with her beauty. Young, artless and innocent, as pretty as a rose, she unwittingly fascinates the prince. His noble bearing likewise impresses her, and his little attentions flatter her, until at length she is unable to resist his advances. The poor girl is meted the usual fate. An alliance is out of the question. The disparity of their ranks even forbids it, and soon the prince must cast her aside. Five years later we find that the girl, who is now a loathsome sight, has learned the bitter lesson of the eternal truth, ""The wages of sin is death."" It is death to the soul at all events. She has gone down to the lowest depths and is arrested in a low Russian tavern. As she is carried to the tribunal she passes Prince Dimitri, who now sees the terrible result of his sins. He grows repentant and attempts to plead her cause before the jury, but they are a callous lot and pay no attention to the arguments for nor against, and by force of habit vote to send her to Siberia. She is dragged out to the pen of detention and herded with a lot of poor unfortunates, who scarcely bear any resemblance to human beings. The repentant prince determines to give up his life to right the wrong he has done, and visits her here with a view of turning her now vicious nature, handing her a copy of the Bible. She does not recognize him at first, but when she does she flies into fury, beating his body and face with her fists and the book. He leaves her and she sits moodily on the bench with the book on her lap. Shortly she turns its pages and lo, the Resurrection! Her eyes fall on the passage (John xi, 25), ""And Jesus said unto her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live."" In an instant her whole being changes. There is hope for her salvation, and she reads on. The guards arrive and we next see her with the poor unfortunates trudging over the snow-clad steppes toward the goal from whence few return. She becomes the ministering angel, sharing her comforts with them. The prince, meanwhile, has secured her pardon and hastens after her. Giving her the welcome notice, he begs her to return with him as his wife: but no, she prefers to work out her salvation helping those poor souls to whom a kindness is an indescribable blessing, and bidding him farewell, she renounces the world for the path of duty, so we leave her kneeling on the snow at the foot of the Holy Cross.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFmZDFjOTYtMWIxNS00ZmRiLWIzODAtMGE5NWFhZmFkYzZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzE0MjY5ODA@.jpg

0001033,The Seventh Day,"Short,Drama",United States,us,N/A,N/A,4.6,20,"Mrs. Herne's social obligations were so impelling as to cause her to neglect her home and her children. So seldom were the two little tots, a boy and a girl, in the company of their mother that they felt an unnatural reserve in her presence. Entreaties and prayers from her husband to give up her mode of living induce her to start an action for divorce, charging incompatibility of temper. This step amazes Herne, but the worst blow is her desire to keep the children, a mother's right. The reasons for her wanting to keep the children are simply pecuniary. Of course, the little ones prefer their papa, having always enjoyed his care, but there's the cold, unsympathetic law to consider. This is the question brought before our modern Solomon when Mr. and Mrs. Herne enter the office of the juror. The law is plain to him, but his judicatory experience has not blunted the humane phase of his nature, so he decides that the children's wishes shall be considered. Therefore he orders that Mrs. Herne shall have the children for seven days, and if at the end of that period she has won their love she may retain them. What a long lonesome week it was for Herne, deprived of his darlings. On the other hand, the poor children are grieving for papa, being left alone with the maid. Mrs. Herne still keeping in the social whirl. However, on the seventh day, the maid meets with an accident, which forces the mother to remain at home and take care of the children.

The court clerk is dispatched to find the reason for her tardiness. He sees, and rushes back to inform the judge.

The rivalry on the part of the latter is friendly, although he is well aware that his position in life does not give him the opportunity of surrounding the girl with the good things of life. The young ship owner's rivalry is of the opposite nature, filled with venom, and he considers it an effrontery that a poor country lad should dare attempt to rival him in the affections of the lady of his choice. The girl is finally put to the test, and in a dramatic scene declares her love for the hero. The unsuccessful ship owner, much angered by his defeat, swears vengeance. Finding the girl alone, the ship owner again attempts to force himself into her favor, but is repulsed. Her infuriated admirer grasps the girl, forcing a kiss upon her lips just as her accepted lover appears upon the scene. The boy, in his anger, knocks the man down, and after a struggle, forces him to apologize. The humiliation hurts him more than the blow, and in his bitterness and anger the ship owner secures the services of some of his seamen attached to a sailing vessel about to leave port and track our young hero as he is leaving a rendezvous with his sweetheart. They attack the youth in a lonely spot, and after a severe struggle, render him insensible and take him aboard the vessel. The lad is forced by the captain to sign articles as an apprentice, then beaten and abused, is made to swab the decks. Biding his time, he strikes the officer in charge, knocking him down. Then plunges overboard and after swimming until he is thoroughly exhausted, reaches the rocks of the shore. (The scenery at this particular point where our hero climbs the rocks with the surf and wild waves dashing about him cannot he excelled.) After eluding the pursuing crew our hero starts back to his lady love's cottage. In the meantime the ship owner has taken into his service a renegade Mexican, and with his aid, after knocking down her old colored servant, kidnaps the now unprotected girl, taking her to an abandoned mission, where he forces an old priest residing there to promise to marry them, regardless of the girl's consent. The youth at last reaches the mainland after a perilous climb over almost inaccessible rocks, and learns from his sweetheart's servitor the story of the outrage. Scarcely able to walk, owing to his former exertions, he secures a horse from a friendly traveler and goes in hot pursuit, reaching the rendezvous just as the final words are about to be spoken. Realizing his helplessness, in his already weakened condition, he grasps a revolver from the Mexican's holster and puts both the ship owner and his accomplice to flight.

The pages of Roman history do not chronicle a more noble deed of self-sacrifice than that set forth in this Biograph story, which shows how a devoted Roman wife and mother went to the very extreme of mental, moral and manual endurance for the sake of her beloved ones. Nerada, a beautiful Roman girl, was much sought by lovers, among whom was Deletius, a wealthy patrician, but she clings to the white rose of purity, rejects the nobleman's gifts and proposals to accept one of her own honest caste, the poor young sculptor, Alachus, whom she marries. Some years later we visit the atelier of Alachus to find that bitter poverty is the lot of the little Roman family, now increased by a child, who is lying ill unto death. The poor sculptor enters, returning from a tiresome, fruitless journey trying to sell his statues, but the very gods seem to conspire, and he is now face to face with that wolverine specter, starvation. Footsore and weak from hunger he sinks down upon the couch fainting. Brave little Nerada, in sore distress, realizes that their life's blood is slowly but surely ebbing for want of nourishment. In desperation she decides to make the sacrifice, though appalling, odious and heart-breaking it may be, by going to the slave mart and sold as a slave that the lives of her husband and child may be saved by the proceeds thereof. Meanwhile, during all these years, Deletius has suffered keenly, for he truly and honestly loved the girl Nerada, and since the time of her rejection of his love, which he then thought, like on many other occasions, was but a fleeting fancy, life was dull, he appears bored and annoyed. The fawning of his slaves and attendant seemed hollow mockery. Nothing seemed possible to lift him out of the slough of ennui, until his secretary conceived the idea of attending the slave mart in the hope of obtaining a new face that might interest him. Entering about the time the slave master puts Nerada on the stand, he is at once determined to procure the beautiful girl feeling sure that here is a means of dissipating the lethargy of his master, Deletius. After spirited bidding, Nerada is sold to the secretary, and is about to be taken to the palace of his master, when Alachus rushes in, having learned of his wife's action. But it is too late; she is another's by right of purchase, so he returns heart-broken to his studio to receive another and more severe blow, his child is dead. Assisted by his friend and neighbor he carries out the precious faded flower for burial. When Nerada is ushered into the presence of her new master, the amazement is mutual. Deletius, at first, is inclined to gloat, but when he hears the desperate, heart-rending appeal of the noble girl, he realizes what a precious jewel true, self-sacrificing love is, so the white rose of purity remains unsullied, and he decides to hand her back to her beloved ones. Repairing to the home of Alachus, what a pitiable scene greets them. Grief has shattered the reason of the poor sculptor, but at the sight of Nerada the veil of darkness slowly fades and the dawn appears.",1909,movie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk2M2YyMDMtYzVkYi00MzgwLTg3ZDctOGYwN2M5YmQxZDY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU3NjUzNTc@.jpg

Joe Morgan, an honest young workman, beloved and honored by all, a respected husband, father and friend, held in the highest esteem by his employers. His character and habits were temperate and upright. He shunned the saloon as one would shun sure death. The story tells of his terrible downfall, when upon one day he is lured by two ""friends"" to take his first drink. The demon rum takes possession of him, he becomes intoxicated and reckless, and his employer, finding him in that condition, takes him home. The wife is horrified and grief stricken. His conscience is stirred and he resolves never again to yield to temptation. But the poison is in his nerves and the next day finds him again at the barroom. The patient wife, waiting for his return, suspects the cause of his absence and sends her little seven-year-old daughter to the saloon. Here follows a most pathetic scene. The child enters the bar as the father, in a drunken frenzy, raises a chair to strike another drunken brawler. The little one confronts him. He is sobered at once and allows the innocent little one to lead him away and take him home. More promises are made, but, of course, the demon's work is not completed. He sinks lower and lower, until, discharged by his employer, he becomes the degraded drunkard whose constant haunt is the barroom, and the wife and child are reduced to poverty and hunger. The pitiful episode of these nights in a barroom is brought to a tragic ending. The little child enters the place to coax her father home, when, in the midst of a usual barroom fight, the child is struck with a large beer glass and falls senseless. Morgan is sobered again, and taking the child in his arms staggers home with her. He is now a nervous wreck and beneath the dreadful strain is overcome by an attack of delirium tremens. Thanks to the patience and devotion of a loving wife, he and the child are nursed back to health. Morgan has had his lesson; it has been a bitter one and has caused much suffering, but from this sorrow and evil comes much good. The drunkard is reformed, he becomes an ardent teetotaler and temperance worker. He is re-established and advanced in his position, and we see him several years later, united with his once more happy family, an honored man and an ornament to society.",1909,movie,N/A

Congress assembled in Carpenter's Hall, where Patrick Henry made his famous speech, the keynote of American independence. The spirit of revolt against English oppression was growing in America, while in England the belief was that the appearance of an English army would surely subdue the Colonists. Washington offered to accept the command of an army should occasion require it. Further and more stringent measures were adopted in Parliament and preparations for hostilities began at once. Military stores at Concord were destroyed, the battle of Lexington soon followed and by this time thoroughly aroused countrymen from all quarters hastened to Boston, the center of operations. This time Congress was in session at Philadelphia and Washington was there unanimously chosen General Commander of the Continental army. He set out at once from Philadelphia, arriving at Cambridge July 3, 1775, where he assumed command of the army. The battle of Bunker Hill meanwhile had been fought and thus proved to the British that their foe was more formidable than anticipated, their loss amounting to four times as many as that of the Colonists. Upon assuming command, Washington hastened to improve the weak points of the Colonies and as the terms of enlistment of his soldiers expired, Washington found his forces greatly depleted. The British, hoping quickly to subdue the Colonists, secured the Hessians to assist. They landed in the southern part of the country, whereupon Washington evacuated Boston and, engaging the enemy at various points on the march, crossed the Delaware in a blinding snowstorm, surprised the Hessians, under Rahl, and put them to rout. The whole Colonial force at this time was approximately five thousand men and, under promises of increased pay and bounties, these were kept together and new recruits added. Omitting the incidents during the intervening time, we find Washington at Valley Forge where he applied himself to forming new plans and cisterns for the army. In a short time the raw recruits were developed into efficient soldiers, the stress of war was shifted to the south, Cornwallis brought his forces from North Carolina into Virginia. Washington concentrated his forces and, aided by the French ships in the mouth of the York River, succeeded in penning up Cornwallis and plans were laid for dealing a decisive blow. The memorable siege of Yorktown was begun and finally ended by the surrender of the British General. After eight years of war a treaty of peace was signed at Paris and the United States became free and independent, the army was discharged, Washington delivered his commission to Congress and retired to private life. Still he watched with solicitude the formation of a government and as a unanimous sentiment pronounced him the people's choice, he reluctantly accepted the office of President. The oath was administered by the Chancellor of the State of New York. Washington at once set about to properly organize the new government, the success of which is a matter of history. Upon the expiration of his second term. Washington retired to domestic life at Mount Vernon. The closing scene pictures Washington at Mount Vernon directing servants in the fields and with his wife holding an informal reception. ""The fame of Washington stands apart from every other in history. His name by all revered forms a universal tie of brotherhood.""",1909,movie,N/A
